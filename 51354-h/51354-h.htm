<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>AN INVITATION</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“I</span> think Labour Day is an awfully funny
holiday,” remarked Patty. “It doesn’t
seem to mean anything. It doesn’t
commemorate anybody’s birth or death or
heroism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like Bank Holiday in England,” said
her father. “Merely to give the poor, tired
business man a rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you don’t specially need one, Daddy;
you’ve recreated a lot this summer; and it’s
done you good,—you’re looking fine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he?” said Nan, smiling at the finely
tanned face of her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fairfields were down at “The Pebbles,”
their summer home at the seashore, and
Patty, who had spent much of the season in
New England, had come down for a fortnight
with her parents. Labour Day was early this
year and the warm September sun was more
like that of midsummer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place was looking lovely, and Patty herself
made a pretty picture, as she lounged in a
big couch hammock on the wide veranda. She
had on a white summer frock and a silk
sweater of an exquisite shade of salmon pink.
Her silk stockings were of the same shade,
and her white pumps were immaculate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fairfield looked at the dainty feet, hanging
over the edge of the hammock, and said,
teasingly, “I’ve heard, Patty, that there are
only two kinds of women: those who have
small feet, and those who wear white shoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty surveyed the feet in question. “You
can’t start anything, Dad,” she said; “as a
matter of fact, there’s only one kind of women
today for they all wear white shoes. And my
feets are small for my age. I wear fours and
that’s not much for a great, big girl like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Deed it isn’t, Patty,” said Nan; “your
feet are very slender and pretty; and your
white shoes are always white, which is not a
universal condition, by any means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a great comfort, Nan,” and Patty
smiled at her stepmother. “Dunno what I’d
do without you, when the Governor tries to
take a rise out of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll buy your flowers, little girl,” and
Nan smiled back, for there was great friendship
and chumminess between these two. “Are
you tired, Pats? You look—well,—interestingly
pale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Washed out, you mean,” and Patty
grinned. “No, I’m not exactly tired, but I’ve
been thinking——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then of course you’re exhausted! You
oughtn’t to think, Patty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! But listen here. This is Monday,
and between now and Saturday night I’ve got
to go to fourteen different functions, of more
or less grandeur and gaiety. Fourteen! And
not one can I escape without making the other
thirteen mad at me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Patty,” said Mr. Fairfield, “that’s
ridiculous. Of course, you can refuse such invitations
as you choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I can’t, Lord Chesterfield. I’ve
got to show up at every blessed one,—or not
at any. I’d like to cut the whole caboodle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you?” asked Nan. “Just retire
into solitude, and I’ll say you’re suffering
from—from——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Temporary mental aberration!” laughed
Patty. “No, that wouldn’t suit me at all.
Why, this afternoon, I’m going to a Garden
Tea that I wouldn’t miss for a farm. There’s
to be a new man there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, just about the last thing you need
on this earth is a new man!” declared her
father. “You’ve a man for every day in the
week now, with two thrown in for Sunday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked demure. “I can’t help it,”
she said. “I’m that entertaining, you know.
But this new man is a corker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child, what langwich, what langwich!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Tisn’t mine. That the way he was described
to me. So, of course, I want to see if
he <span class='it'>is</span> any good. And, you won’t believe it, but
his name is Chick Channing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is. Chickering Channing, for long,
Chick for short.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>was</span> his mother thinking of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dunno. Prob’ly he was named for a rich
uncle, and she couldn’t help the combination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of Mona’s Western friends. Arrives
today for a week or so. Mona’s Tea is in his
honour, though she was going to have it anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mr. Fairfield, judicially, “of
course you must go to that Tea, and subjugate
that young man. Then have him over here
and I’ll size him up. If you want him, I’ll buy
him for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, dear Father, but I have toys
enough. Well, then, tonight is the Country
Club Ball. And I do hate that, for there are so
many uninteresting people at it, and you have
to dance with most of them. And tomorrow
there’s a poky old luncheon at Miss Gardiner’s.
I <span class='it'>don’t</span> want to go to that. I wish I could
elope!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you, Patty?” said Nan, sympathetically;
“cut it all, and run up to Adele’s,
or some nice, quiet place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adele’s a quiet place! Not much! Even
gayer than Spring Beach. And, anyway, it
isn’t eloping if you go alone. I want to elope
with a Romeo, or something exciting like that.
Well! for goodness gracious sakes’ alive! Will
you <span class='it'>kindly</span> look who’s coming up the walk!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They followed the direction of Patty’s dancing
blue eyes and saw a big man, very big and
very smiling, walking up the gravel path, with
a long, swinging stride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little Billee!” Patty cried, jumping up and
holding out both hands. “Wherever did you
descend from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t descend; came up. Up from the
South, at break of day,—Barnegat, to be exact.
How do you do, Mrs. Fairfield? How are
you, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth’s kindly, breezy manner, condoned
his lack of conventional formality, and with an
easy grace, he disposed his big bulk in a deep
and roomy wicker porch chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how’s the Giddy Butterfly?” he said,
turning to Patty. “Still making two smiles
grow where one was before? Still breaking
hearts and binding them up again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” and she dimpled at him. “And I have
a brand-new one to break this afternoon. Isn’t
that fine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine for the fortunate owner of the heart,
yes. Any man worthy of the name would
rather have his heart broken by Patty Fairfield
than—than—to die in a better land!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hobson’s choice,” said Mr. Fairfield, drily.
“Are you here for a time, Farnsworth? Glad
to have you stay with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir, but I’m on the wing. I expected
to spend the holiday properly, fishing
at Barnegat. But a hurry-up telegram calls
me up to Maine, instanter. I just dropped off
here over one train, to catch a glimpse of Little
Sunshine, and make sure she’s behaving herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a Angel,” declared Patty, with a heavenward
gaze. “And, Bill, what do you think!
I was just saying I wanted to elope. Now, here
you are! Why don’t I elope with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it must be some one, it might as well be
me,” returned Farnsworth, gravely; “have you
a rope ladder handy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always keep one on hand,” returned Patty,
gaily. “When do we start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right away, now, if you’re going with me,”
and Bill laughed as Patty sat up straight and
tied her sweater sash and pretended to get ready
to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this is the strange part,” he went on;
“you all think I’m fooling, but I’m not! I do
want to carry Patty off with me, on this very
next train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is so sudden!” said Patty, still taking
it as a joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You keep still a minute, Milady, and let me
explain to your elders and betters.” Patty
pouted at this, but Bill went on. “You see,
Mr. Fairfield, I’m involved in some big business
transactions, which, not to go into details,
have made it necessary for me to become the
owner of a large hotel up in Maine,—in the
lake region.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought all Maine was lakey,” put in Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this is a smallish lake, not far from
Poland Spring. And it’s a big hotel, and it’s to
close tomorrow, and all the guests will leave
then. And I’ve got to go up there and look
after it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you happen to acquire this white
elephant?” asked Fred Fairfield, greatly interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had to take it for a debt. Man couldn’t
pay,—lost his money in war stocks.—I’ll tell
you all about it while Patty’s getting her bag
packed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” cried Nan, seeing
Farnsworth’s apparent sincerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord, I forgot I haven’t told you yet!
Well, as I have to go up there for a week or
two, and as the hotel is all in running order,
and as all the guests are going off in a hurry,
and the servants are still there, I thought it
would be fun to have a sort of a house party
up there—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gorgeous!” cried Patty, clapping her hands,
“Who’s going, Bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the rub! I haven’t asked anybody
yet, and I doubt if I can get many at this time
of year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t asked anybody! I thought you had
planned this house party!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, I just got the telegram last
night, and it was on the train coming up here
this morning that I planned it—so the plans
aren’t—aren’t entirely completed as yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you fraud! You made it all up on the
spur of the moment——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m, I did. But what a spur the moment
is! Now, see here, it’s clear sailing. We can
get the Kenerleys and they’ll be the chaperons.
Now, all we have to do, is to corral a few
guests. You and I are two. How about Mona
Galbraith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’d go if she could,” said Patty, “but
she’s having a party this afternoon. Chick
Channing is over there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chick Channing! Is he really? Well! Well!
I haven’t seen that boy for years. We must
make them come. And Daisy? Is she there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, but don’t get too many girls——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be alarmed, you little man-eater, you!
The Farringtons will go, maybe; and Kit Cameron
and his pretty cousin. Oh, I’ve a list of
possibles, and we’ll get enough for a jolly little
crowd. You’ve no objections, have you?” and
Farnsworth looked anxiously at the elder Fairfields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-no,” began Nan, “but it isn’t all clear to
me yet. Suppose the Kenerleys can’t go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That puts the whole plant out of commission.
Unless,—oh, by Jove! wouldn’t you two
go? That would be fine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Fairfield and Nan refused to be
drawn into any such crazy scheme. It was all
right for young people, they said, but not for
a comfort-loving, middle-aged pair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll tell you,” said Farnsworth, after
a moment’s thought. “I’ll get the Kens on the
long distance, and find out for sure. Meantime,
Butterfly, you be packing a few feathers,
for sumpum tells me Adele will go, anyway,
whether old Jim does or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might as well throw some things in a suitcase
I s’pose,” said Patty; “it’s better to be
ready and not go than to go and not be ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a long session at the telephone, Bill announced
a triumphant success. The Kenerleys
would be glad to go. Moreover, Adele would
meet Patty and Bill in New York that very day
in time for a late luncheon. Then they would
get the Farringtons and the others by telephone.
Then Patty would go home with Adele
for the night, and they would all go to Maine
the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see it’s very simple,” said Bill, with
such an ingenuous smile that Nan went over to
his side at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it is,” she agreed. “It’s simply
lovely! And Patty wanted to get away from
the giddy whirl down here. She’ll have the
time of her life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Fairfield was not so sure. “I think
it’s a wild goose chase,” he said. “What sort
of a place are you going to? You don’t know!
What sort of service and creature comforts?
You don’t know! What will you get to eat?
You don’t know! That’s a nice sort of outlook,
I must say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, easy now, sir. It isn’t as bad as all
that. I’ve had rather definite and detailed reports,
and if it weren’t all comfy and certain,
I wouldn’t take Patty up there. It’s a Lark, you
see, a Lark,—and I’m sure we’ll get a lot of fun
out of it. And, incidentally, I know it’s a fine
section of country,—healthful, invigourating,
and all that. And the house is a modern up-to-date
hotel. They always close soon after
Labour Day, but this year, owing to circumstances,
it’s the very day after. That’s where
the fun comes in, having a whole hotel all to
ourselves. But we must be getting on. The
train leaves in twenty minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all ready,” said Patty, as she re-appeared,
miraculously transformed into a lady
garbed for travelling. A silk pongee coat protected
her gown and a small hat and veil completed
a smart costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t altogether like it——” began Mr.
Fairfield, as they got into the motor to go to
the train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run along, Patty,” said Nan. “I’ll see to
it that he does like it, before you leave the station.
Going to Mona’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, just for a minute. You see her as soon
as we’re gone, and tell her all about it. We
can only say the barest facts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They flew off, Patty’s veil streaming behind,
until she drew it in and tied it round her neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Red Chimneys, several young people were
playing tennis, but Patty called Mona to her
and told her briefly of the plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glorious!” cried Mona. “If it were not
for that old Tea, we could go right along now.
But we’ll come tomorrow. Where shall we
meet you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly Farnsworth told her, and then turned
to see his old friend, Channing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chick, old boy!” he cried. “My, but it’s
good to see you again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing was presented to Patty, who looked
at him in amazement. He was the biggest man
she had ever seen, even taller than Bill Farnsworth.
He looked enormously strong, and
when he smiled, his large mouth parted to show
two rows of big, white, even teeth, that somehow
made Patty feel like Red Ridinghood before
the wolf. But there was little time for
getting acquainted, for it was almost train time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few words between the two men as to meeting
next day, and then the motor flew to the
station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And only just in time, for though Bill handed
Patty on to the steps with care, he had to scramble
up himself as the train was about to start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you like eloping?” he said, smilingly,
as they rolled away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine,” said Patty, dimpling, “but must it
always be done in quite such a hurry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always; next time we’ll take it easier.
Now, let’s make a list of our house guests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth took out a notebook and pencil,
and they suggested various names, some
of which they decided for and some against.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Patty said, in an assured tone, “And
Phil Van Reypen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not on your life!” exclaimed Bill. “If he
goes <span class='it'>I</span> don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Little Billee, we couldn’t have the
party at all without <span class='it'>you</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll have it without <span class='it'>him</span>! See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty pouted. “I don’t see why. He’s an
awfully nice man, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you do, do you? Why don’t you stay
home, then, and have him down at the seashore
to visit you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that wouldn’t be half as much fun. But
up there is that lovely place, all woodsy and
lakey and sunsetty, I could have a splendid time,
if I had all my friends around me.” Patty’s
sweet face looked very wistful, and Farnsworth
scanned it closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it mean so much as that to you, Patty?
If it does, you shall have him invited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t care. It’s your party, do just as
you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it’s my party, I want to do just as
<span class='it'>you</span> like.” Bill spoke very kindly, and Patty
rewarded him with a flash of her blue eyes, and
the subject was dropped.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap2'></a>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE HOTEL</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“T</span>his is a little like a real eloping, isn’t
it?” and Bill gave Patty’s suitcase to
a porter, whom they followed across
the big Pennsylvania station in New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A <span class='it'>very</span> little,” said Patty, shaking her head.
“You see it lacks the thrill of a real out-and-out
elopement, because people know about it.
An elopement, to be any good, must be a secret.
If ever I get married, I’m going to elope, that’s
one thing certain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Patty, how unlike you! I thought
you’d want a flubdub wedding with forty-’leven
bridesmaids and all the rest of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I s’pect I shall when the time comes. I
often change my mind, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet you do! You change it oftener
than you make it up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I couldn’t——” began Patty, and just
then they reached the taxicab rank, and Bill
put Patty into a car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went to the Waldorf, where they were
to meet the Kenerleys, and found that Jim and
Adele had just arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a perfect scheme!” exclaimed Adele,
as soon as greetings had been exchanged.
“Who all are going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go to luncheon,” said Bill, “and then
we can thrash out things. I reserved a table—ah,
here we are,” as the head waiter recognised
the big Westerner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love to go round with Bill,” said Patty,
“he always has everything ready, and no fuss
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sure does,” said Jim Kenerley, in hearty
appreciation. “But the way he scoots across
the country and back, every other day or two,
keeps him in trim. He lives on the jump.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” agreed Farnsworth. “But some day
I hope to arrange matters so I can stay in the
same place twice running.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laughing at this sally, they took their places
at the table, which Bill’s foresight had caused
to be decorated with a low mound of white asters
and maidenhair fern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How pretty!” cried Patty. “I hate a tall
decoration,—this is just right to talk over.
Now, let’s talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And talk they did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just flew off,” Patty declared, as she told
Adele about it. “Nan’s going to pack a trunk
and send it, when she knows we’re truly
there. I think she feared the plan would fizzle
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed it won’t,” Bill assured them. “We’ve
got the nucleus of our party here, and if we
can’t get any more, we can go it alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was by no means difficult to get the
others. Some few whom they asked were out
of town, but they responded to long distance
calls, and most of them accepted the unusual
invitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth had a table telephone brought,
and as fast as they could ring them up, they
asked their guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two Farringtons were glad to go; Marie
Homer and Kit Cameron jumped at the chance.
Mona and Daisy, with Chick Channing, would
come up from the shore the next day, and that
made eleven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Van Reypen?” asked Kenerley, as they
sought for some one to fill out the dozen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up to Patty,” said Bill, glancing at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” and Patty shook her golden head,
slowly; “no, don’t let’s ask Phil this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” said Adele in astonishment. “I
thought you liked him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do; Phil’s a dear. But I just don’t want
him on this picnic. Besides, he’s probably out
of town. And likely he wouldn’t care to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reasons enough,” said Farnsworth, briefly.
“Cross off Van Reypen. Now, who for our
last man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peyton,” said Jim. “Bob Peyton would
love to go, and he’s a good all-’round chap.
How’s that, Bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Patty?” and Bill looked inquiringly
at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed. Mr. Peyton’s a jolly man. Do
you think he’d go, Adele?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like a shot!” Kenerley replied, for his wife.
“Bob’s rather gone on Patty, if you know what
I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who <span class='it'>isn’t</span> gone on Patty?” returned Farnsworth.
“Well, that’s a round dozen.
Enough!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty,” Patty decreed. And then the talk
turned to matters of trains and meetings and
luggage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll arrange everything for the picnic,” said
Bill. “You girls see about your clothes and
that’s all you need bother about. You’ll want
warmish togs, it gets cool up there after sundown.
Remember, it’s Maine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty and Adele at once began to discuss what
to take, and Patty made a list to send to Nan
for immediate shipment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an enormous piece of humanity that
Chicky is!” said Patty, suddenly remembering
the stranger. “Do you know him, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; known him for years. He’s true blue,
every inch of him. Don’t you like him, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say yet. I only saw him half a jiffy.
But, yes, I’m sure I shall like him. Bill says
he’s salt of the earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all of that. And maybe a little pepper,
as well. But you and old Chick will be chums,
I promise you. Now we’ll pack you two girls
off to Fern Falls, and I’ll do a few man’s size
errands, and Bill, here, will make his will and
dispose of his estate, before going off into the
wilderness with a horde of wild Indians. Then
tomorrow, he’ll pick us up at Fern Falls, and
we’ll all go on our way rejoicing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so fast,” said Adele, after Jim finished
his speech. “You two men can go where you
like, Patty and I will take a taxi, and do some
last fond lingering bits of shopping, before we
go home. Don’t you s’pose we want some shoes
and veils and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sealing-wax?” asked Farnsworth, laughing.
“All right, you ladies go and buy your millinery,
and I’ll see you again tomorrow on the
train.”</p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>As might have been expected, with such capable
management, everything went on smoothly,
and it was a clear, bright afternoon when they
completed the last stage of their journey, and
the train from Portland set them down at their
destination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not quite at their destination, however, for
motorbuses were in waiting to take them to the
hotel itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For more than an hour they bumped or glided
over the varying roads, now through woods,
and now through clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, a vista suddenly opened before them,
and they saw a most picturesque lake, its dark
waters touched here and there by the setting
sun. It was bordered by towering pines and
spruces, and purple hills rose in the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stunning!” cried Patty, standing up in the
car to see better. “I never saw such a theatrical
lake. It’s like grand opera! Or like the
castled crag of Drachenfels, whatever that is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to recite that at school,” observed
Chick Channing; “so it must be all right, whatever
it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, as they turned a corner, the hotel
itself appeared in sight. An enormous structure,
not far from the lake, and set in a mass of
brilliant salvias and other autumn flowers and
surrounded by well-kept velvety greensward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a peach of a hotel!” and Patty’s eyes
danced with enthusiasm and admiration. “All
for us, Little Billee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All for we! Room enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so! I’m going to have a suite,—maybe
two suites.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody can have all the rooms he wants,
and then some. I believe there are about five
hundred——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” cried Daisy Dow, “five hundred! I
shall have a dozen at least. What fun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cars rolled up to the main entrance.
Doormen, porters, and hallboys appeared, and
the laughing crowd trooped merrily up the
steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never had such a lark!” declared Mona.
“Oh, I’ve seen hotels as big,—even bigger,—but
never had one all to myself, so to
speak. Isn’t it just like Big Bill to get up this
picnic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marie Homer looked a little scared. The
vastness of the place seemed to awe her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chr’up, Marie,” laughed her cousin, Kit
Cameron. “You don’t have to use any more
rooms than you want. How shall we pick our
quarters, Farnsworth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let me see. Mr. and Mrs. Kenerley
must select their rooms first. Then the ladies
of the party; and, if there are any rooms left
after that, we fellows will bunk in ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, followed by the whole laughing troop,
Adele and Jim chose their apartments. They
selected two elaborate suites on the second floor,
for Bill told them that there were scores of
servants, and they were better off if they had
work to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it heavenly?” sighed Elise Farrington,
dropping for a moment on a cushioned
window-seat, in Adele’s sitting-room, and gazing
at the beautiful view. “I want my rooms
on this side of the house, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the girls on this side,” decreed Adele,
“and all the men on the other. Or, if the
men want a lake view, they can go up on the
next floor. If I have to comfort you girls,
when you’re weeping with homesickness, I want
you near by. Marie, you’re most addicted to
nostalgia, I recommend you take this suite next
to mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Marie was installed in a lovely apartment,
next Adele’s and with practically the same view
of the lake and hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy’s came next, then Mona’s, and Patty’s
last. This brought Patty at the other end of
the long house, and just suited her. “For,”
she said, “there’s a balcony to this suite, and
if I feel romantic, I can come out here and bay
the moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll do nothing of the sort, young
woman,” said Adele, severely. “You do that
moon-baying act, and you’ll be kidnapped
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you,” and Patty shuddered, “I’ve
had quite enough of that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rooms were beautifully furnished, in good
taste and harmonious colourings. The hotel had
been planned on an elaborate scale, but for
some reason, probably connected with the management,
had not been successful in this, its first
season; and in swinging a business deal of some
big lumber tracts in that vicinity, it had fallen
into Farnsworth’s hands. He had no intention
of keeping it, but intended to sell it to advantage.
But at present, it was his own property
and he had conceived the whim of this
large-sized picnic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boom! Boom!” sounded Channing’s deep
bass voice in the hall. “That’s the dressing-gong,
people. Dinner in half an hour. No
full dress tonight. Just a fresh blouse and a
flower in your hair, girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he great?” said Patty to Mona, as they
responded through their closed doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the girls’ suites of rooms could all be made
to communicate, and they ran back and forth
without using the main hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is,” agreed Mona, who was brushing her
hair at Patty’s dressing-table. “And the more
you see of him, the better you’ll like him. He’s
shy at first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shy! That great, big thing shy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; he tries to conceal it, but he is. Not
with men, you know,—but afraid of girls.
Don’t tease him, Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me tease him!” and Patty looked like an
injured saint. “I’m going to be a Fairy Godmother
to him. I’ll take care of him and shield
him from you hoydens, with your wiles. Now,
go to your own rooms, Mona. I should think,
with half a dozen perfectly good rooms of your
own, you might let me have mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t bear to leave you, Patty. You’re
not much to look at,—I know,—but somehow
I forget your plainness, when——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona dodged a powder-puff that Patty threw
at her, and ran away to her own rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later, Patty went slowly down
the grand staircase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adele had decreed no evening dress that first
night, so Patty wore a little afternoon frock of
flowered Dresden silk. It was simply made,
with a full skirt and many little flounces, and
yellowed lace ruffles fell away from her pretty
throat and soft dimpled arms. Its pale colouring
and crisp frilliness suited well her dainty
type, and she looked a picture as she stood for
a moment halfway down the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you aren’t a sight for gods and little
fishes!” exclaimed a deep voice, and Patty saw
Chickering Channing gazing at her from the
hall below. “Come on down,—let me eat
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Patty reached the last step, he grasped
her lightly with his two hands and swung her
to the floor beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” exclaimed Patty, decidedly taken
aback at this performance. “Will you wait a
minute while I revise my estimate of you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For better or worse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds like something—I can’t think
what—Declaration of Independence, I guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wrong! It’s from the Declaration of Dependence.
But why revise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve ticketed you all wrong! Mona said
you were shy! <span class='it'>Shy!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Methinks the roguish Mona was guying you!
Shyness is <span class='it'>not</span> my strong point. But, if you
prefer it should be, I’ll cultivate it till I can shy
with the best of them. Would you like me
better shy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I should, if only to save me the trouble
of that revision.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shy it is, then.” Whereupon Mr. Channing
began to fidget and stand on one foot, then
the other, and even managed to blush, as he
stammered out, “I s-say, Miss F-Fairfield,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was such a perfect, yet not overdone burlesque
of an embarrassed youth, that Patty
broke into peals of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” she cried. “Be yourself, whatever
it is. I can’t revise back and forth every two
minutes! I say, Mr. Chickering Channing,
you’re going to be great fun, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bid me to live and I will live, your Funnyman
to be. Whatever you desire, I’m it. So
you see, I am a nice, handy man to have in
the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed you are. I foresee we shall be
friends. But what can I call you? That whole
title, as I just used it, is too long,—even for
this big house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what the rest call me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty pouted a little. “I never call people
what other people call them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord, more trouble!” and Chick rolled
his eyes as if in despair. “Well, choose a name
for yourself——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I want one for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a <span class='it'>funny</span> young miss! Well,
choose, but don’t be all night about it. And
I warn you if I don’t like it, I won’t let you
use it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘<span class='it'>Shy!</span>’ Oh, my!” murmured Patty. “Well,
I shall call you Chickadee, whether you like it
or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I like it,—I <span class='it'>love</span> it! But, nearly as
many people call me that as Chick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I thought it was original with me! All
right, I’ll think up another, and I shan’t speak
to you again until I’ve thought of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nonchalantly turning aside, Patty walked
across the great hall to where a few of the
others had already gathered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty Patty,” said Kit Cameron, in his
wheedling way; “wilt thou stroll with me, after
dinner, through the moonlight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wilt not,” answered Adele, for her.
“Look here, young folks, if I’m to chaperon
you, I’m going to be pretty strict about it. No
strollings in moonlights for yours! If you want
gaiety, you may have a dance in the ballroom.
The strolling can wait till tomorrow, and then
we’ll all go for a nice walk round the lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dance!” cried Patty, “better yet! Who
would go mooning if there’s a dance on? I’ll
give you the first one, Kit. Oh, you haven’t
asked for it, have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>I</span> have, Patty,” said Farnsworth’s voice
over her shoulder, “will you give it to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promised Kit,” said Patty, shortly, and
then she turned to speak to Bob Peyton about
a golf game next day.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap3'></a>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>A MIDNIGHT MESSAGE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>D</span>inner in the big dining-room was
great fun. A large, round table had
been prepared for the party, and the
smaller, unoccupied tables all about, were also
decorated with flowers to give a festive atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As there were scores of idle waiters, each of
the party could have one, or more, if desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth seated his guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll sit here,” he announced, “and I’ll ask
Mrs. Kenerley to sit at my right. The rest
of you may sit where you choose, alternating,
of course, the girls and the men. Now, here’s
my plan. At every meal, the men sit as we do
tonight, and the ladies move one seat to the
right. This gives us new companions each
time, and prevents monotony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s me,” said Patty, dropping into the
chair at Bill’s left hand, while Channing sat
the other side of Patty. Laughingly, they all
found places, and dinner was served.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an unusual experience. The hotel
dining-room was ornate in design and appointments,
and its green and gold colouring and
soft glow of silk-shaded lights made a charming
setting for the merry party round the big
table. The other tables, and there were many
of them, looked as if they might be occupied
by the ghosts of the departed guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like being castaways on a beautiful and
very comfortable desert island,” said Patty, as
she looked appreciatively at a huge tray of
hors d’œuvre offered her by a smiling waiter.
“I do love these pickly-wickly things, and never
before have I felt that I might take my time
in choosing. But, here at——what’s the name
of the hotel, Bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind the name on its letter-heads,”
he returned, “we’ll call it Freedom Castle.
Everybody is to follow his or her own sweet
will,—or somebody else’s if that seems pleasanter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who has the pleasantest will?” asked Patty,
looking around; “I want to follow it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” said Chick, promptly. “My will
is something fierce in the way of pleasantness.
I daresay every one here will fall all over themselves
in their haste to follow it. Ha, do I
hear a familiar strain? I do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did, for just then the hotel orchestra, a
fine one, struck up a popular air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Music, too!” exclaimed Mona. “All the
comforts of home, and none of the cares. This
is just too perfect! Billy Boy, you’re a wonder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To think of it being Bill’s hotel!” said
Daisy, in an awed voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To think of our being here without any
bills,” put in Roger Farrington. “That’s the
best part of it. It’s like being given the freedom
of the city!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The freedom of the country,” Adele corrected;
“that’s much better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The orchestra, on a platform, gorgeous in
scarlet, gold-braided coats, began a fascinating
fox-trot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kit Cameron looked across the table at Patty,
with a nod of invitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smiling assent, Patty rose, flinging her napkin
on the table. Kit came round to her, and
in a moment they were dancing to the music
that had called them. Skilfully, Kit guided her
among the maze of tables and chairs, for they
were the two best dancers in the crowd, and
they had no difficulty in avoiding obstacles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a turn, Adele?” asked Bill, laying
down his fork.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you; it’s all very well for the
girls, but your chaperon is too nearly middle-aged
for such capers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense; but maybe you’re wise to save
your energies for an evening dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several of the young people did dance a few
turns, but Chick Channing speedily caused them
to halt by announcing the arrival of mushrooms
under glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoosh!” cried Kit, “back to nature! We
can dance at any old time, but mushrooms under
glass are an event! I say, Bill, I’m glad
the cook didn’t leave with the guests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole serving force is under contract
for a fortnight longer,” explained Farnsworth.
“You can live on mushrooms, if you
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Paradise,” said Marie Homer, ecstatically;
“I don’t ever want to go home. Does
the mail come regularly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody laughed at Marie’s look of anxiety,
and Bill replied, “Yes, my child, you can
get your daily letter from him up here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t write <span class='it'>every</span> day,” said Marie,
so innocently that they all roared again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish <span class='it'>I</span> had somebody to write love-letters
to me,” sighed Patty. “It must make life very
interesting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll write them to you,” offered Chick. “It’s
no trouble at all, and I’m the little old complete
love-letter writer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right here in the spot, though, so
that’s no fun. I mean somebody who isn’t
here,—like Marie’s somebody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you must have plenty of absent adorers.
Can’t you encourage their correspondence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then I’d have to write first, and I hate
to do that, it’s so—so sort of forward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, to be sure. But it’s better to be forward
than forlorn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m not exactly forlorn!” said Patty,
indignantly. “I can be happy with all these
others, if t’other dear charmer <span class='it'>is</span> away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you, Patty?” whispered Bill. “Are
you happy here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho, Little Billee, I am beatifically happy!
Just see that confection Louis is bringing in!
Could I be anything but happy with that ahead
of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dessert that had just appeared was indeed
a triumph of the confectioner’s art. Composed
of ice cream, meringue and spun sugar,
it was built into an airy structure that delighted
the sight as well as the palate. Everybody
applauded, and Adele declared it was really a
shame to demolish it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a shame not to,” said Patty,
her blue eyes dancing in anticipation of the delicious
sweet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a little gourmande you are,” said
Chick, watching Patty help herself bountifully
to the dessert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Deed I am. I love sweet things, they always
make me feel at peace with the world. I
eat them mostly for their mental and moral
effect on me, for my disposition is not naturally
sweet, and so I do all I can to improve
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet you give the effect of a sweet dispositioned
person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is,” spoke up Daisy, overhearing.
“Why, Chick, Patty is the sweetest nature ever
was. Don’t you believe her taradiddles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the lady so slightly, I’m not much
of a judge. But I feel sure she’ll improve on
acquaintance,” and Chick looked hopeful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so, I’m sure,” and Patty’s humble
expression of face was belied by the twinkle
in her eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then dinner was over, and Adele rose and
led the way to the great salon or drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come for a little walk on the veranda,”
said Chick to Patty. “Let’s get more acquainted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty caught up a rose-coloured wrap from the
hall rack, and they went out and strolled the
length of the long veranda that went round
three sides of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid crowd,” said Chick, enthusiastically;
“and right down fine of old Bill to do
this thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>is</span> fine,” said Patty, impulsively; “whatever
he does is on a big scale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His friendships are, I have reason to know
that. He’s done heaps for me, dear old chap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you known him long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three or four years. Met him through
Mona. Good sort, Mona.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mona’s a dear. She’s the sort that
wears well. Where is your home, Mr. Chick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nowhere, at present. I’ve lived in Arizona,
but I’ve come East to grow down with the
country. I’m a mining engineer, at your service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love to employ you, but, do you know, I
seldom have need of the services of a first-class
mining engineer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m not so awfully first-class. Bill thinks
he can use me in his manœuvres. We talked it
over a bit on the way up, and I hope so, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I hope so, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. You’re a kind lady. Shall we
sit in this glassy nook and flirt a bit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached a portion of the veranda,
glass-enclosed, and arranged with seats among
tall palms and jars of flowers. There were
shaded lights and a little illuminated fountain
in the centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll stop here a moment, but I can’t flirt,”
said Patty, demurely; “my chaperon won’t allow
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allowed flirting is no fun, anyway. Forbidden
fruit is sweetest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But sour grapes are forbidden fruit. How
can sour be sweet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s all according to your nature. If you
have a sour nature, the grapes are sour. If a
sweet disposition, then all fruits are sweet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even a lemon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody hands a lemon to sweet people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then they can’t have any lemonade, and I
love it! I guess I’ll stop being so sweet——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious, Patty, you couldn’t do <span class='it'>that</span>
if you tried!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This remark was made by Kit Cameron, who
just then put his head in at the doorway and
overheard Patty’s laughing decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, you two,” he went on; “you’ll have
to stop your introspective conversation, and
come and join the dance. Will you, won’t
you come and join the dance? We’re only to
have one, our dragon chaperon declares, and
then we must all go by-by. So come and trip
it, Patty of the fairy toes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trio returned to the drawing-room, and
after the one dance had been extended to half
a dozen, Adele collected her headstrong
charges and carried them off to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re not to have kimono confabs all
night, either,” she ordered. “Patty, you’ll be
good for nothing tomorrow, if you don’t get
some rest. And the others, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was more or less chattering and
giggling before the girls separated for the
night. It seemed natural for them to drift into
Patty’s boudoir and in their pretty negligées
they dawdled about while Patty brushed her
hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What goldilocks!” exclaimed Marie, in admiration.
And truly, Patty’s hair was a thing
to admire. Thick and curling, it hung well below
her waist, and shone with a golden glimmer
as the light touched its rippling lengths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an awful nuisance,” Patty declared;
“there’s such a lot of it, and it does snarl
so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me help you,” cried Daisy, springing up
and taking the brush from Patty’s hand.
“Mona, do the other side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona seized another brush and obeyed, and
as the two brushed most vigorously, Patty’s
little head was well pulled about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, girls, oh, <span class='it'>thank</span> you <span class='it'>ever</span> so
much, but truly, I <span class='it'>don’t</span> mind doing it myself!
Oh, <span class='it'>honestly</span>, I don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty rescued her brushes, and soon had the
rebellious locks in two long pigtails for the
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, scoot, all of you,” she said, “this is
the time I seek repose for my weary limbs, on
beds of asphodel—or—whatever I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beds of nothing,” said Mona, “I’m not a
bit sleepy. Let us stay a little longer, Patty,
dear,—sweet Patty, ah, <span class='it'>do</span> now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> can’t,” and Marie started toward the
door. “I’m awfully sleepy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t fool me, my infant,” said Patty,
wisely. “Your eyes are like stars burned in
a blanket! <span class='it'>I</span> know what you’re going to do!
But don’t be alarmed, I won’t tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marie blushed and with murmured good-nights,
ran away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to write a letter, of course.” And
Daisy wagged her sapient head. “Who is the
man, Pat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fie, Daisy! You heard me say I wouldn’t
tell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You only said you wouldn’t tell what she’s
going to do. And we know that. Do tell us
who he is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t do it. If Marie chooses, she will
tell you herself. And anyway, Daisy, it’s no
one you know. I don’t think you ever saw him
and I doubt if you ever even heard of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he nice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charming. Full of capers, though. And
Marie is so serious. But he’s very attractive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they engaged? Oh, Patty, <span class='it'>do</span> tell us
about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t. I don’t know so very much about
it myself; but what I do know is a sacred trust,
and not to be divulged to a horde of rattle-pates.
Now, will you make yourselves scarce?
Go and write letters, go and darn stockings,—anything,
but let me go to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, Patty shooed the girls away, and locking
her door against their possible return, she
began to make ready for bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at her watch as she sat at her
toilette-table. It was exactly midnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that moment her telephone rang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those girls!” she thought to herself. “I’ll
not answer it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the bell kept ringing, and Patty took
down the receiver with a soft “Hello.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you, Patty?” and her astonished ears
recognised Philip Van Reypen’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For mercy’s sake! Where are you, Phil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home. In New York. Can you hear me
all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, plainly. How did you know I was
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Learned it from your father. Say, girlie,
why didn’t you get me a bid up there, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Do</span> I! Aren’t <span class='it'>you</span> there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a reason?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best in the world. Do get Farnsworth
to invite me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t, Phil. He doesn’t want any—any
more than we have here now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean he doesn’t want <span class='it'>me</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, doesn’t he like you?” Patty’s voice
was full of innocent surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t that, but he wants you all to himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! There are a dozen of us up
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I mean he’s afraid to have <span class='it'>me</span> there.
By Jove, Patty, that’s a sort of a compliment.
He’s afraid of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be silly, Philip. How’s Lady Van?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s all right. She’s at Newport, just now.
I’m in town for a day or two, so thought I’d
call up Spring Beach and maybe run down there
to see you. And this is the immediate result.
Well, look here, Patty, if I can’t get invited to
Farnsworth’s Palace Hotel, for I hear it’s that,
I’m going to Poland Spring, and then I can
run over and see you anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Philip, <span class='it'>don’t</span> do that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? Haven’t I a right to go to Poland
Spring, if I like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but don’t come over here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t exactly explain it, myself; at least
not over the telephone, but I don’t think it
would be nice for you to come here when you
were not invited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I was spoken of, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,—yes,—since you will have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Farnsworth wouldn’t have me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,—I said not to have you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you <span class='it'>did</span>! What a nice friend you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Phil, don’t talk like that. I said—I
said——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless your heart, I know just how it was. Or
nearly. But you could have had me asked—and
you didn’t! Now, my lady, just for that,
I <span class='it'>am</span> going to Poland Spring—start tomorrow.
And,—listen, now,—if you really don’t want
me to come over to the Farnsworth House,
then you must come over to the Poland Spring
House to see me! Get that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Phil, absurd! How could I go
alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t come alone. Bring a chaperon,
or another girl or a crowd of people if you like,
or even a servant, but <span class='it'>come</span>! That’s all, so
good-night, little girl. Pleasant dreams!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The telephone clicked as Phil hung up, and
with a little gasp, Patty hung up her receiver
and threw herself on a couch to think it over.
She couldn’t help laughing at the coil she was
in, for she well knew she couldn’t go to Poland
Spring House, unless with the whole crowd,—or
nearly all of them. She pictured Bill reaching
there to be greeted by Philip Van Reypen!
Dear old Bill; after all he had done to make it
pleasant for them, to hurt his feelings or to
annoy him in any way, would be mean. She
wished Phil had kept out of it. She wished
there wasn’t any Phil nor any Little Billee, nor—nor—anybody,—and
somehow Patty’s long,
brown lashes drooped over her pansy blue eyes,—and,
still robed in her chiffon and lace peignoir,
and all curled up on the soft, spacious
couch,—she fell sound asleep.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap4'></a>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>BLUE ROCK LAKE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>I</span>n a blaze of September glory, the sun
shone across the lake. The leaves had
not yet begun to turn, and the summer
trees were as green as the stalwart evergreens,
but of varying shades. From deep, almost
black, shadowy forests, the range ran to brilliant,
light green foliage, in a gamut of colour.
Some of the younger and more daring trees
crept down to the water’s edge, but much of
the lake shore was rocky and more or less
steep. Here and there a picturesque inlet had
a bit of sandy coast, but the main effect was
rugged and wild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even the intrusive sun could only peep
into Patty’s boudoir through a chink or two between
the drawn shades and the window frames.
And so his light was not enough to wake the
sleeper, still cuddled among the couch pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was awakened by a bombardment of
raps on the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty!” called Daisy’s impatient voice;
“whatever <span class='it'>are</span> you doing? Open this door!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blue eyes flew open. But Patty was the
sort of person who never wakes all at once.
Nan always said Patty woke on the instalment
plan. Slowly, and rubbing her eyes, she rose
and unlocked the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Patty Fairfield!” Daisy exclaimed,
“your lights are still burning! You—why,
<span class='it'>look</span> at you! You didn’t undress at all! You
have on your evening petticoat and slippers!
and the very same boudoir robe I left you in
last night. And”—Daisy looked in at the
bedroom door,—“your bed hasn’t been slept
in! What <span class='it'>is</span> the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy rattled on so, that Patty, still half
asleep, was bewildered. “I don’t know——”
she began, “Philip called——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Philip called! Patty, are you crazy? Wake
up!” Daisy shook her a little and under this
compulsion Patty finished waking up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious!” she exclaimed, laughing,
“did I sleep there all night? No wonder I
feel like a boiled owl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why,—<span class='it'>why</span> did you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlesticks, I don’t know. It’s no crime,
I suppose. I lay down there for a few minutes,
after you hoodlums cleared out, and I suppose
I fell asleep and forgot to wake up. That’s
all. Lemme alone, and a bath and a cup of hot
chocolate will restore my senses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear little goose! I’ll run your tub for
you. Though I suppose there are a string of
maids waiting outside your door. Want ’em?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, rather have you. But send half a dozen
of them for some choclit, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still yawning, Patty began to take off her slippers
and stockings. “Thank you, Daisykins,”
she said, as Daisy returned from the bathroom.
“Now, you light out, and I’ll make a respectable
toilette. My, how I did sleep. I was
worn out. But I feel fine now. Good-bye,
Daisy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Daisy was slow to take the hint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Patsy, what did you mean by saying
Philip called?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty hesitated for the fraction of a second,
and then decided it were wiser to keep her
own counsel regarding that matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dreaming, I s’pose. Certainly, there was
no Philip here in reality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you said distinctly that Philip called,”
Daisy persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, s’pose I did? What could it have
been but a dream? Do you imagine I had a
real, live caller?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but it must have been a vivid dream!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was,” said Patty. “Now scoot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy scooted, and Patty locked her door
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re a pretty one!” she said to herself;
“the idea of sleeping all night without
going to bed. Adele will be terribly exercised
over it. But I have other things to worry about.
I wonder if Philip will really come up here,
and if he does, what Bill will do. Would I
better tell Bill about it? Or, just let the situation
develop itself? Oh, what troubles some
poor little Pattys do have! Come in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This last in response to a gentle tap at the
hall door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A trim maid entered with a tray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, joy!” cried Patty; “I’m simply starving,——Mary,
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sarah, ma’am,” returned the girl, gazing
admiringly at pretty Patty, who was now in a
kimono of light blue silk, edged with swans-down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Sarah, stay a few moments, and you
can help me dress. Sit down there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah obediently took the small chair Patty
designated, and folded her hands on her immaculate
frilled apron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about the hotel, Sarah,” said Patty,
as she crunched the crisp toast between her
white teeth, and smiled at the maid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about it, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let me see; how did you maids feel
when you found the guests were leaving?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At first we feared we’d lose our money,
miss; then we were told that our contracts held
till the end of this month, and if we would stay
as long as we were asked to, we’d get paid in
full.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wasn’t that nice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine, ma’am. I’m using mine for my little
sister’s schooling, and I’d sore miss it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So all the servants were willing to stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, ma’am. You see, none could get
good places up here. The hotels all have their
own, and many of them will close the first of
October.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. Isn’t it funny to have a dozen guests,
and the rest of this big place empty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, indeed, miss. Shall I get you some
hotter chocolate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ve finished, thank you. Now, you call
somebody else to take the tray, and you stay
to help me. I’ve taken a fancy to you, Sarah,
and I want you for my personal maid while I’m
here. Is that all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, miss. I’m proud to do for you.
But I’m not a trained lady’s maid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, I’ll train you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty had a nice way with servants. She was
always kind, and treated them as human beings,
yet never was she so familiar that they
presumed on her kindness. She soon discovered
that Sarah, though untrained, was deft
and quick to learn, and she instructed the maid
in the duties required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, when Adele came tapping at the door,
she found Patty seated before the mirror, while
Sarah was coiling the golden hair according to
directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, girlie, what’s this I hear about your
sleeping on a couch, when a perfectly good bed
was all turned down for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just one of my whimsies,” returned
Patty, airily. “Don’t bother about it, Adele.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Adele was wise and kind enough not to
bother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon, arrayed in a most becoming white serge,
with emerald green velvet collar and cuffs and
a pale green silk blouse, Patty descended the
great staircase to find most of the party grouped
there, about to start for a ramble round the
lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Course I’ll go,” she said in answer to eager
inquiries. “My hat and gloves, Sarah, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss Patty,” and the maid, who had
been following her, returned upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve adopted Sarah as my personal bodyguard,”
Patty said. “You don’t mind, Bill, do
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit!” he replied heartily. “The house
is yours and the fulness thereof. I hope all of
you ladies who want maids, or keepers of any
sort, will call on the service force for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah came down then, bringing Patty’s hat,
a soft felt, green, and turned up on one side
with a Robin Hood feather. It was most becoming,
as Patty tilted it sideways on her head,
adjusting it before a large mantel mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we’re off,” she said, gaily; “but we
ought to have Alpenstocks, or swagger-sticks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here are some,” said Bill, opening a
cupboard door, and disclosing a lot of long
sticks. Everybody selected one, and they set
forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such a wonder-place!” exclaimed Marie, as
at every fresh turn they found some new bit
of scenery or different view. “I could stay here
forever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me too!” agreed Mona. “What’s the name
of the lake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like Skoodoowabskooskis,” said
Bill, laughing; “but for short, everybody calls
it Blue Rock Lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because the rocks on the other side look so
blue, I suppose,” suggested Daisy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you’re right!” cried Chick, in mock
amazement at her quick perception. Whereupon
Daisy made a face at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t mind him, Daisy,” said Patty;
adding, teasingly, “it’s perfectly true, the
distant rocks do look blue, hence the term,
Blue Rock Lake,—blue rocks and the lake,
see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you smarty!” and Daisy lost her temper
a little, for she hated to be made fun of;
“if you tease me, I’ll tease you. What about
a girl who wakes up, babbling of some ‘Philip’
or other!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Babbling nothing!” cried Patty. “And
anyway, I’m always babbling, asleep or awake.
Oh, see that bird! What a beauty!” As a
matter of fact there was no bird in sight, but
canny Patty knew it would divert attention from
Daisy’s remark, and it did. After vainly looking
for the beautiful bird, other distractions
arose, and Patty breathed more freely that nobody
had noticed Daisy’s fling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after they had walked all round the lake,
and were nearing the hotel again, Bill stepped
to Patty’s side and falling in step with her, put
his strong, firm hand under her elbow, saying:
“Want some help, little girl, over the hard
places?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing, who had been at her other side,
took the hint and fell behind with some of the
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this about your waking up with
Philip’s name on your lips?” he said; “do you
want to see him so badly? If so, I’ll ask him
up here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty hesitated; here was her chance to get
the invitation that Phil so coveted, and yet, she
knew Bill Farnsworth didn’t want him. Nor
was she sure that she wanted him, herself, if
he and Little Billee weren’t going to be friendly.
A nice time she would have, if the two men
were cool or curt to each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she said, “No, I don’t want him, especially.
I daresay I was dreaming of him. I dream a
lot anyway, of everything and everybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='mome'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i061.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:450px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>A moment Patty thought. Then she said, “No thank you, Billie, I don’t.”</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Dreaming?” said Farnsworth, in a curious
voice; “is that all, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all the communication you had with
Van Reypen last night? In dreams?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked up, startled. Did Bill know of
the telephone message? Would he care?
Patty felt a certain sense of guilt, though, as
she told herself, she had done nothing wrong.
Moreover, the only reason she had for not telling
Farnsworth frankly of Phil’s message, was
merely to spare him annoyance. She knew he
would be annoyed to learn that Phil had called
her at midnight on the long distance, and if he
didn’t already know it, she would rather he
shouldn’t. But did he, or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, how else could I talk to him?” she
said, laughingly. “Do you suppose I am a
medium and had spirit rappings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose nothing. And I know only what
you choose to tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is nothing, also. Why, Little Billee,
you’re in a mood this morning, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced up into the face of the man who
strode beside her. It was a fine face. Strong,
well-cut features made it interesting rather than
handsome. It was also a determined face, and
full of earnestness of purpose. But in the blue
eyes usually lurked a glint of humour. For the
moment, however, this was not noticeable, and
Farnsworth’s lips were closed rather tightly,—a
sure sign with him, of seriousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you choose to tell me nothing, I accept
your decision. But once more I ask you, for
the last time, do you wish me to invite Van
Reypen up here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment Patty thought. Then she said,
“No, thank you, Billee, I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth’s brow cleared, and with a sunny
smile down at her, he said: “Then the incident
is closed. Forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” and Patty smiled back, well
pleased that she had decided as she did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You little goose!” said he, “I know perfectly
well that you called up Van Reypen on
the telephone last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not!” declared Patty, indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Apple Blossom, don’t tell naughty
stories. I say, I <span class='it'>know</span> you did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Mr. Farnsworth, if you doubt my
word, there’s nothing more to be said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was thoroughly angry, and when she
was angry she looked about as fierce as a wrathy
kitten. But, also, when Patty was angry, a few
foolish tears <span class='it'>would</span> crowd themselves into her
eyes, and this only served to make her madder
yet. She turned from him, wanting to leave
him and join some of the others, but she
couldn’t, with those silly drops trembling on
her eyelashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look up, Apple Blossom,” said a gentle
voice in her ear. Farnsworth’s voice was one
of his chief charms, and when he modulated it
to a caressing tone, it would cajole the birds
off the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked up, and something in her blue
eyes glistened through the tears, that somehow
made her look incapable of “telling a naughty
story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, Posy-Face,” Farnsworth murmured,
“I <span class='it'>will</span> believe you, whatever you tell
me. I will believe you, whether I think you’re
telling the truth or not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this rather ambiguous statement, Patty
looked a little blank. But before she could
ask further explanation, they had reached the
hotel and they all went in.</p>

she was between Jim Kenerley and Chick Channing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome, little stranger,” said Chick, as
they sat down. “I’ll have you now, and again
tonight at dinner, sitting by me side, and then
life will be a dreary blank, while you slowly
jog all round the table, getting back to me, two
days after tomorrow. How the time will
drag!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re so flattering!” and Patty pretended
to be terribly pleased. But, as a matter of fact,
she was wishing she could sit next Little Billee,
and find out whether he was really angry at
her. Also, she decided she would tell him all
about the telephone message, for he apparently
believed she had told him a falsehood. And,
too, it occurred to her, that he might not make
any great distinction between calling and being
called on the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think about it? Shall us go?”
said Chick, and Patty realised, with a start, that
she had been so lost in her thoughts, that she
hadn’t heard the talk at table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go where?” she asked, looking blank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come back from dreamland, and learn
what’s going on. Cameron knows of a wonderful
hermit, who lives in a shack in the woods
and tells fortunes. Do you want to snatch the
veil from the hidden future, and learn your
fate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed; I just love fortune tellers!
Where is he, Kit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Off in the woods, in a tumble-down old
shanty. But he’s the real thing in seers! I was
out for an early morning prowl, and I discovered
him. Bobbink, that’s my pet bellhop, says
he’s greatly patronised by the populace, but
though he gets lots of coin, he won’t move into
better quarters or disport himself more as a man
of means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I want to go to see him,” Patty declared.
“Will you go, Billee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t go this afternoon, Patty; I’m sorry,
but I have another engagement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So have I,” said Daisy, looking a little conscious.
“Let’s leave Mr. Fortune Teller till
tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All agreed to this, and after luncheon was
over, they proceeded to plan various sports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tennis, Patty?” asked Chick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; too poky.” And Patty gave a restless
gesture, most unusual with her, and only indulged
in when she was bothered about some
trifle. She wanted to get a moment alone with
Farnsworth and tell him about Phil. She knew
from the way Little Billee looked at her, or,
rather, didn’t look at her, that he was hurt or
offended, or both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Golf then?” Chick went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, too slow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how ’bout lawn bowls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never tried lawn bowls! Oh, they’re lots
of fun. Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a short time they had collected half a dozen
people and were in the midst of a gay game,
when Farnsworth suddenly appeared, riding a
big, black horse. Very stunning he looked, for
his riding togs were most becoming and he sat
his horse with all the grace and easy carelessness
of the Western rider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Billee,” cried Patty, dropping the bowling
ball she was about to roll, “I want to go
riding!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she was covered with chagrin, for
Daisy came out of the hotel, also garbed in the
trimmest of riding costumes, and a groom led
a horse for her to mount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you, Patty?” said Bill, not unkindly, but
with a disinterested air. “You may. There
are lots of horses in the stables.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty quickly recovered her poise. “Thank
you,” she cried, gaily; “a little later, then. Will
you go, Chick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will I! Just try me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll finish this game, and then there
will be time enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The game over, they went for a ride. Patty’s
riding habit was dark green, of modish cut and
style. She was a good horsewoman, though she
seldom rode. Channing, likewise, was a good
rider, but he made no such picturesque effect
in the saddle as Big Bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whither away?” he said, as they started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it too far to go over to Poland Spring
House?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit. It’s a goodish distance, but the
road is splendid, and it isn’t four yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they set off briskly for that destination.
The exhilarating air and exercise quite restored
Patty’s good humour, and she cast off all
thought of petty botherations and enjoyed herself
thoroughly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great!” she exclaimed, smiling at Chick, as
they flew along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, isn’t it? And it’s not so very far,
we’re nearing the approach to the place now.
We’ll have time for tea, and get back well before
dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lovely! Oh, what a big hotel! And <span class='it'>will</span>
you look at the squirrels!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, the lawn and verandas were
dotted with fat gray squirrels. They were very
tame and had no fear of people or horses.
They welcomed Patty and Chick, by sitting up
and blinking at them as they dismounted and
grooms took their horses away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Asking for the tea room, they were shown the
way, and ushered to a pleasant table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chocolate for me, please,” said Patty, as the
waiter stood with poised pencil. “I hate tea.
So chocolate, and dear little fussy cakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chocolate is mine, too, then. Whatsoever
thou eatest that will I eat also. Well, by Jove,
will you look over there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked in the direction that Chick’s eyes
indicated, and there, at a small table, busily
eating cakes and tea, sat Farnsworth and Daisy
Dow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we join them?” asked Chick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Join them! Oh, no, they don’t want joiners.
They’re absorbed in each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did look so. Bill was earnestly talking
and Daisy was listening with equal intentness.
Her face was bright and animated, while Farnsworth’s
was serious and thoughtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was angry at herself for being one whit
disturbed at sight of them, thus chummily having
their tea, and she tossed it off with a gay
laugh. “Besides, I’d rather chat with you
alone than to have a foursome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good girl, Patty,” and Chick nodded approvingly.
“Do you know I think you’re about
as nice as anybody, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I you,” and Patty sipped her chocolate
with an air of contentment. “This is a
much bigger hotel than ours, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but ours is more beautiful, I think, and
quite big enough for our party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Oh, what a stunning-looking
woman! See, Chick, over toward your
left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing turned slightly to see a very handsome
dark-eyed woman, who smiled at him as
their glances met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, bless my soul!” he exclaimed; “if it
isn’t Maudie Kent. I say, Patty, don’t you
want to meet her? She’s an actress, or was,
and she’s a dear. Awfully good form and all
that, and really worth while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’d love to know her,” said Patty, looking
with interest at the stunning gown the lady
wore. It was of flame-coloured silk, veiled with
black net, and was matched by a wide hat of
black with flame-coloured plumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me a moment, then,” and Channing
rose and went over to where the lady stood.
She was alone, and he had no difficulty in persuading
her to come to their table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear child,” said Miss Kent, as Channing
introduced them; “how pretty you are!
I’m so glad to know you. But what are you
doing here with Chick Channing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just having tea,” said Patty, smiling back
into the big dark eyes that looked at her so
kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But are you staying here? Where are your
people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are staying over at Freedom Hall,”
she began, and then paused, for with those
eyes upon her, she couldn’t quite make it seem
a rational thing to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s quite all right, Maudie,” Channing
put in, “there’s a crowd of us, with chaperons
and things, and our good host, by the way, is
right across the room, at a tea-table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That good-looking chap with the pretty girl?
Oh, it’s Mr. Farnsworth! Mayn’t I know her,
too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, see here, Maudie, you can’t know
everybody that I do. Be content with Miss
Fairfield, at least for the present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am, more than content. No, I’ll have
coffee, please. Chocolate is only for the very
slim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely you are that,” ventured Patty, glancing
at the graceful form of the new acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I wouldn’t be, if I indulged in sweet
things. Enjoy them while you may, my dear,
in after years you’ll be glad you did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing here, Maudie?” asked
Channing. “Are you alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I’m having a concert tonight, and I’m
in such trouble. You see,” she turned to Patty,
“I’m a sort of professional entertainer. I give
concerts or recitals, and I get performers of
the very best and usually they are most dependable
and reliable. But tonight I have a
concert scheduled, and my prima donna is lacking.
If she doesn’t come on this next train, I
don’t know what I shall do. I suppose I shall
have to give back the ticket money, and call
the affair off, and that means a great loss to
me. For I have to pay the other performers
their price just the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a shame,” said Channing, sympathetically.
“But she’ll surely come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid not. I’ve telegraphed and I can’t
get her anywhere. I can’t help thinking she
deliberately threw me down because she received
a better offer, or something of the sort.
But I mustn’t bore you with my troubles. Forget
it, Miss Fairfield, and don’t look so concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry for you,” said Patty, “to go
to all that trouble and expense, and have it all
for nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Less than nothing,” said Chick, “for you
stand to lose considerable, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, well over five hundred dollars. Oh,
here are the motorbuses from the train. Now
we’ll see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though many guests arrived at the hotel
the singer was not amongst them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Miss Kent, scanning them sadly,
“she isn’t here. Oh, what shall I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s mind was working fast. She knit her
brows as she tried to think calmly of a wild
project that had come into her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Kent,” she began, and stopped; “I
wonder—that is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear, what is it? Do you want
to ask something of me? Don’t hesitate, I’m
not very terrifying, am I, Chick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed. What is it, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course, it wouldn’t do,—I hate to
suggest it, even,—but you see, Miss Kent, I
can sing——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Patty can impersonate the absent
singer! And nobody would ever know the difference!
Great!” cried Channing. “Oh,
Maudie, your trouble is at an end!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now wait,” said Patty, blushing. “I am not
a professional singer, but I have studied with
good masters, and I have a voice, not so very
big, but true. Forgive this plain speaking, but
if I could help you out, Miss Kent, I should be
so glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a little darling!” exclaimed Maud
Kent; “I wonder if we <span class='it'>could</span> carry off such a
thing. You see, your coming here, as you just
did, a stranger, and talking to me only, looks
quite as if you were the arriving singer. That
part’s all right. As to your voice, I have no
doubts about that, for you <span class='it'>didn’t</span> say you sang
‘a little.’ And any way, even a fair singer
would do, in addition to the talent I have. But
Miss Fairfield, I can’t accept this from you.
Will you take just the price I expected to give
M’lle Farini?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t accept money, Miss Kent. That
would be impossible. I’m glad to do this to help
you out, for it’s no trouble for me to sing, I
love to do it. And don’t bother about the payment.
Give it to some charity, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t accept your services without pay!
But if you knew what a temptation it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yield to it, then,” and Patty smiled at the
troubled face. “But first, you must hear my
voice. You can’t decide before that. Where
can we go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come up to my apartment, no one will hear
us there, and if they should, it’s no great harm.
One may practise, I suppose. You may come
too, Chick, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three left the tea-room, and as they disappeared
through the door, Farnsworth caught
sight of Patty’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does that mean?” he cried, so angrily
that Daisy was startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does what mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see who went out that door?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty and Chick Channing and Maudie
Kent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the first two, but who is Maudie
Kent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An actress! A woman Channing and I knew
in San Francisco a good while ago. What can
she be doing here? And how did she get hold
of Patty? Though of course, Chick is responsible
for that. But what are they up to? I’m
going after them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill, don’t do anything so foolish! Patty has
a right to visit the lady if she wants to. It
isn’t your business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Patty—with that woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, isn’t she a nice woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s an actress, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, lots of actresses are lovely ladies.
Isn’t this one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course, she’s a lovely lady. But
Patty oughtn’t to be racing round with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty wasn’t racing! She wouldn’t do such
a thing in Poland Spring House. Now, Bill,
put it out of your mind. There’s no occasion
for you to get stirred up because Patty has
made a new acquaintance. And I guess Chick
Channing can take care of her, he wouldn’t let
her know anybody who wasn’t all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chick is thoughtless. He likes Maudie, and
so do I. But she’s no fit companion for Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Is Patty Fairfield better than us
common people? Is she made of finer clay?
Wouldn’t you want <span class='it'>me</span> to meet the Maudie
lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you. Why, that wouldn’t matter so
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill Farnsworth! What a speech! I guess
I’m every bit as good as Patty Fairfield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you are, Daisy. Don’t be silly.
But you’re more—more experienced, you know,
and a little less—less conventional. Patty has
never had half the experience of the world that
you have. I don’t want her mixed up with that
sort of people, and I won’t have it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” and Daisy spoke coldly, “I don’t see
how you can help it. They’ve gone off, and you
can’t very well follow them, or have them arrested.
Probably Chick and Patty are starting
for home. And I’m sure it’s time we
did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t go off and leave Patty here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t do anything else. You’re not
Patty’s keeper, Bill, and it’s silly to act as if
you were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so, Daisy.” Farnsworth’s fine face
looked anxious and his eyes were sad. “Come
on, I suppose we had better be going. I’ll order
the horses round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth kept a sharp eye out, but he saw
no more of the trio who had left the tea room,
and who had so disturbed him. In quiet mood
he rode off at Daisy’s side, and they went back
to the hotel.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap6'></a>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>MAUDE’S CONFIDENCES</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>M</span>eantime, Patty, in Miss Kent’s parlour,
was singing her best. The scheme
appealed to her very strongly. She
was glad to assist the kind and beautiful lady,
and moreover, she enjoyed an escapade of any
sort, and this surely was one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Kent was delighted with her voice, and
predicted an ovation for her. They selected
several of Patty’s best songs, and had the accompanist
in to rehearse with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about dress?” said Patty, after it
was positively settled that she was to sing at
the concert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll ride over and get you whatever you
want,” said Channing, anxious to be of service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” said Miss Kent, “that would be a
shame for you to go to all that trouble. I have
a little white tulle gown that can be made just
right in a jiffy. I am a bit taller than Miss
Fairfield, but a tuck will fix that. Now, here’s
an important point. You see, the notices and
the programmes all say M’lle Farini will sing.
Shall we let it go at that? I mean, let Miss Fairfield
impersonate M’lle Farini, or shall we have
an announcement made at the opening of the
concert, that Miss Fairfield is acting as substitute?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather let it go without the use of my
name,” said Patty. “I don’t know as it would
be quite right, but I’d love to let people think I
was the Farini lady. It would be such fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Miss Kent, “let’s just leave it.
If we don’t say anything of course the audience
will take it for granted that you are M’lle
Farini. And if any objections are raised, or if
it comes out afterward, I can say that I had to
substitute you at the last moment, and there
was no time to have new programmes printed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be fine,” Patty declared; “I do
love a joke, and this is really a good one, I
think. Yes, let me be M’lle Farini, for one
night only, and if the real owner of that name
objects, why, it will be all over then, and she’ll
have to take it out in objecting. But I shan’t
disgrace her, even if I don’t sing as well as she
does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you do, Miss Fairfield,” exclaimed Miss
Kent; “she has a fuller, stronger voice, but
yours has more melody and sweetness. You
will remain here over night, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I never thought about that!” and Patty
looked a little alarmed. “I don’t know what
Adele will say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please do. You really must. I have
two bedrooms in my suite, and I can make you
very comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” and Patty hesitated; “I’ll have to
talk this thing over with Mrs. Kenerley. I’ll
telephone her now, and if she is willing, I will
stay here all night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty called up Adele and told her the
whole story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adele listened, and then she laughed, good-naturedly,
and told Patty she could do as she
liked. “I think it’s a harum-scarum performance,”
she said, “but Jim says, go ahead, if you
want to. You stay with your new friend all
night. Of course you couldn’t come home after
the concert. I suppose Mr. Channing will stay
at that hotel, too. And then he can bring you
home in the morning. What will you wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty told her, and then she asked Adele not
to tell the others what she was up to. “I’m
afraid they’ll come over,” she said; “and I can
carry it through all right before strangers, but
if all you people sat up in front of me, giggling,
I couldn’t keep my face straight, I know; so
don’t tell them till after it’s over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, girlie, I will keep your fateful
secret locked in my heart till you bid me speak.
Have a good time, and sing your sweetest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that’s all right,” and Patty looked enchanted
at the prospect of fun ahead. “I’m
going to have the time of my life! You go
away now, Chick, and Miss Kent and I will see
about my frock. Shall we meet at dinner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I want you two girls to dine with me.
Do you know anybody, Maudie, to make a
fourth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, wait, Chick. I don’t want to dine in
public. Nor do I want Miss Fairfield to be
bothered with a company dinner. I’ll tell you
a better plan. She and I will dine alone, here
in my little parlour. You get your dinner
downstairs, by yourself, and then, after the
concert is over, you can invite us to supper and
we can talk it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing acquiesced, and then he went away,
not to see them again until supper time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are so good, Miss Fairfield——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do call me Patty. I like it so much
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be glad to. And you must call me Maude.
It is a perfect Godsend, your helping me out
like this. May I tell you just a little bit about
myself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would. And I’m so glad I can be
of service to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But first they must needs attend to the all-important
matter of Patty’s frock, and sure
enough, a white tulle of Maude’s was easily
and quickly altered till it just fitted Patty. It
was new and modish, made with full skirts and
tiers of narrow frills. There was no lace or
other trimming, save the soft tulle ruffles, and
Maude decreed no jewelry of any sort, merely
a few yellow roses at the belt,—the tiny mignon
roses. These she ordered from the office, and
by that time their dinner was served.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they sat enjoying the few but well-chosen
dishes that Maude had selected, she told Patty
somewhat of her life, and Patty listened with interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have to support myself, my mother and a
crippled sister,” Maude said, “and I had ambition
to become a great actress. But after a
fair trial, I found I could be at best only a
mediocre actress. I found, however, that I had
talent for organizing and arranging entertainments,
and I concluded I could make more
money that way than on the stage. So I took
it up as a regular business, and I have succeeded.
But this year has not been a very good
one. I’ve had some misfortunes, and twice I
didn’t get the money due me, because of dishonest
assistants. And, I tell you truly, Patty,
if I had lost five or six hundred dollars tonight,
it would have been a hard blow. You have
saved me from that, and I bless and thank you.
Do you realize, little girl, what you are doing
for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad I can. Tell me about your sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clare? Oh, she is the dearest thing! She
never has walked, but in spite of her affliction
she is the happiest, cheeriest, sweetest nature
you ever saw. I love her so, and I love to be
able to get little delicacies and comforts for
her. See, here is her picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty took the case and saw the portrait of a
sweet-faced girl, little more than a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is a dear, Maude. I don’t wonder you
love her. Oh, I’m so glad I happened over
here today. Do you know Bill Farnsworth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met him once or twice the same winter I
met Chick Channing. Mr. Farnsworth seemed
very stiff and sedate. Chick is much more
fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chick is gayer, but Bill is an awfully nice
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was with a vaudeville troupe that year.
It wasn’t very nice,—hard work and small pay.
It was my last attempt on the stage. If I
couldn’t be a big and fine actress I didn’t want
to be any at all. So I’m glad I gave it up for
this sort of work. This season is about over
now, and I shall have entertainments in New
York this winter. I’ve lots of influential patrons,
and I hope for success. But I shall never
forget your heavenly kindness in helping me
out tonight. Now, perhaps, we had better be
getting dressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty made a careful toilette, for she wanted
to look her best, and she succeeded. The soft
dainty white tulle was exceedingly becoming,
and she had done her hair the prettiest
way she knew. Maude’s slippers were the
least bit loose, but they looked all right, and
Patty refused a loan of a pair of long white
gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re not wearing them with evening
gowns this season,” she said, “and I hate them,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right,” and Maude surveyed her
critically. “Your arms are lovely,—so soft
and dimpled. You are more effective without
gloves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the opening numbers of the concert,
Patty sat in the ante-room waiting her turn.
She was not nervous or apprehensive, and
when the time came, she walked out on the
platform and bowed gracefully, with a cordial
little smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was to sing almost exactly the selections
of M’lle Farini. But she had substituted others
in one or two instances, and, of course, for
encores, she could make her own choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there were plenty of encores. Patty’s
sweet voice charmed by its sympathy and
grace, rather than by volume. And it made a
very decided hit with the audience. They applauded
continuously until Patty was forced to
respond a second and a third time, after each
of her numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing, sitting in the audience, heard people
saying, “Who is this Farini? I never
heard of her before. Her voice is a little wonder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Kent was delighted with Patty’s success.
She had felt sure the hearers would like Patty’s
music, but she did not expect such unanimous
approval nor such enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four times Patty was announced to sing, and
as each was encored at least once, it made a
good many songs. At the last appearance she
was very tired, but she bravely endeavoured not
to show it. She went through the number
beautifully, but the deafening applause made
it impossible for her not to give them one more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” said Patty, as Maude came to her
with entreaties. “I’m all in, as the boys say.
Oh, well, I’ll sing one more little thing. No
accompaniment at all, please, Maude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Patty returned to the platform and when
the enthusiastic welcome ceased, she sang very
softly a little cradle song. The haunting sweetness
of the notes and the delicate languor of
Patty’s tired voice made an exquisite combination
more effective even than her other work.
She finished in a pure, fine minor strain, and
with a little tired bow, walked slowly from the
stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the house went wild. They clapped and
shouted brava! and demanded more. But the
concert was over; Miss Kent made a little
speech of thanks, and the footlights went out.
Reluctantly, the people rose from their seats,
but hung around, hoping to get a glimpse of
M’lle Farini.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='voice'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i088.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:450px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>Patty’s sweet voice charmed by its sympathy</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t so much her voice,” Chick overheard
somebody say, “as the way she has with her.
She’s charming, that’s what she is, charming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t have supper in the dining-room,”
Maude said, laughingly, to Channing. “Patty
would be mobbed. Those people are just lying
in wait for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want to,” cried Patty. “I’ve done
the work, now I want the fun. Let’s have supper
there. They won’t really come up and
speak to me, when they don’t know me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t they!” said Maude. “But indeed
you shall have supper wherever you like. You
deserve anything you want. Come on, Chick,
it’s to be just as Patty says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So to the supper-room they went, and there
Patty became the observed of all. At first, she
didn’t mind, and then it became most embarrassing.
She could hear her name mentioned
on all sides, and though it was always coupled
with compliments, it made her uncomfortable
to be so conspicuous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though of course,” she said gaily, “they’re
not talking about me, but about M’lle Farini.
Well, I’m pretty hungry, Chick. Maude made
me eat a light dinner, as I was going to sing.
Now I want to make up. Can I have some
bouillon, and some chicken <span class='it'>à la</span> king, and some
salad, and some ice cream?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, what a little gourmande! Why,
you’d have nightmare after all that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I wouldn’t. I’m fearfully hungry. Honest
I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty had her selection, and though she
ate little of each course, she took small portions
with decided relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel like a new lady!” she declared when
she had finished. “Is there dancing? Can
I have a turn? I don’t want to go to bed
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you can dance,” said Maude.
“But you must remain M’lle Farini for the
evening. Can you remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Course I can. It’ll be fun. Besides, I’m
only going to have one trot with Chick and
then I’ll go by-by, like a good little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as might have been expected, after her
one dance, Patty was besieged by would-be
partners, clamouring for an introduction. The
manager of the hotel was bribed, cajoled, and
threatened in the various efforts of his
guests to get introductions to Patty and to
Miss Kent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just one or two,” Patty whispered to
Maude, and so two or three young men won
the coveted presentation, and Patty was urged
to dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this she refused. She wanted to chat a
little with these strangers, but she didn’t care
to dance with men so lately made acquainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing acted as bodyguard, and his close
inspection would have barred out any one he did
not altogether approve of. But they were a
nice class of men, polite and well-bred, and
they were entertaining as well. Patty had a
right down good time, and not the least part
of the fun was the masquerading as another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are staying here long, M’lle Farini?”
asked Mr. Gaunt, an attractive man of musical
tastes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Patty replied, “I have to leave early
in the morning. I’m due to sing at another
hotel tomorrow night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, a near-by house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not very. Do you sing, Mr. Gaunt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, baritone. I’d like to sing with you.
I’ve an idea our voices would blend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure they would. I love to sing duets.
But,” and pretty Patty looked regretful, “it
cannot be. We will never meet again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you be so sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel it. But tomorrow I’m going to have
my fortune told. If the seer says anything
about our future meeting, then I’ll look for
you later on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the seer is a true soothsayer, and no fake,
he can’t help telling you we will meet again;
because it is a foregone conclusion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall expect you and look forward
to the meeting,” and Patty held out her hand
to say good-night, for it was after midnight,
and Maude was making signs for her to come
with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But just then a clerk came toward them with
a puzzled face. “There’s a telephone call for
a Miss Fairfield,” he said; “and the speaker
says she’s here with Mr. Channing. Are you
Mr. Channing, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Chick. “It’s all right. M’lle
Farini has occasion to use different names in
her profession. Which booth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing, beckoning to Patty, followed the
man, and whispered to her to take the message,
as it must be from some of the Freedom Castle
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty went into the booth, and to her surprise
was greeted by Philip Van Reypen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she exclaimed, a little annoyed, “is
this a habit? Do you expect to call me up every
night at midnight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Pattykins, don’t get mad. I called
you up to apologize for what I said last night.
I take this hour, ’cause I know you’re all
wrapped up in people all day, and only at night
do you have a moment to waste on me, and I
<span class='it'>must</span> tell you how sorry I am that I was rude
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rude, how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, telling you I was coming up there
whether you asked me or not. You don’t want
me to, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Phil, since you ask me plainly, I <span class='it'>don’t</span>.
Not but that <span class='it'>I’d</span> like to see you, but I’m here
on Bill Farnsworth’s invitation, and since he
didn’t ask you,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know. And it’s all right. I don’t
want to butt in where I’m not asked. And I’m
sorry I called you up, if it bothered you.
And——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Phil. Now if you’ve any more to
say, can’t you write it? For I’m just going to
bed. Good-night.” And Patty hung up the
receiver.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap7'></a>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE FORTUNE TELLER</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>N</span>ext morning Patty and Maude had a
cosy little breakfast in the latter’s apartment,
and then, arrayed in her riding
habit, Patty went down, to find Channing waiting
for her on the veranda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, M’lle Farini,” he said gaily,
“ready for a ride? Come along with us, won’t
you, Maude?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thank you, Chick. I’m not altogether
certain that Patty’s friends will forgive this
performance and I’d be afraid to see them.
But, oh, I can’t tell you both what it has meant
to me, and I do hope you’ll have no cause to
regret it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit of it! I’ll fix it up all right,” and
Chick looked very big and powerful. “If
anybody goes for Patty, he’ll hear from me!
See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do want to see you again, Maude,”
said Patty, as they bade farewell. “Shall you
be here long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only two or three days, at most. I have
another concert here tomorrow night, but I’m
sure of my artists for that. Do ride over again,
both of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will,” promised Channing, and then the
two cantered away.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Here they come!” cried Daisy, as from the
porch of Freedom Castle she spied the two
equestrians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Kenerley was at the block to help Patty
alight, and as she ran up the steps, Adele
clasped her in a welcoming embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear child!” she said. “What an experience
you have had. Sit down here and tell
us all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty told the whole story, exactly as it
had happened, and Channing added details
here and there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody was interested and asked all sorts
of questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it a nice hotel?” asked Mona. “Did
you have any fun after the concert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was dancing,” said Patty, “but I was
too scared, when people called me M’lle Farini,
to enjoy it much. I wanted to get away. I’m
glad I did it for Miss Kent, but—never
again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she’s the Maude Kent I once knew,
you had no business to have anything to
do with her,” put in Farnsworth, in a gruff
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s the Miss Kent Chick Channing knows,
and that’s enough for me!” retorted Patty,
and a little pink spot showed in either cheek, a
sure sign that she was annoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, shall we go to the hermit’s?” said
Elise, anxious to avert the impending scene.
“What <span class='it'>do</span> you think, Patty, Kit has a toothache,
and can’t go, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toothache!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a bad ulceration. He sent down word
by Bobbink, that pet bellboy of his, that we
were to go on without him. The boy will show
us the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How ridiculous! Why not wait till tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Kit says the hermit man expects us and
we must go. You’ll go along, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course. Shall I change this rigging,—or
go as I am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go as you are. It’s time we were off. Roger
and Mona have gone on ahead, but as they
went in the opposite direction, I am not sure
they’ll get there before we do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those two have a fancy for going in the opposite
direction,” laughed Patty; “ever notice
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not being stone blind, I have,” Elise admitted,
and really the interest Roger and Mona
had for each other became more apparent each
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Kenerleys declined to go on the hermit
expedition, saying that they knew their “fortune,”
and had no reason for questioning the
future. So the others started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing took possession of Patty, and
merely saying “which way?” he led her across
the wide lawn to the indicated path through
the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elise followed, with Bob Peyton, who greatly
admired the pretty New York girl. Farnsworth
and Daisy Dow brought up the rear of
the procession, and Bobbink, the ever useful
courier, showed the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cameron says for you to do jes’ wot I
says,” he announced, evidently greatly pleased
at his position of power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead, Bobbink,” said Bill; “show us
the way, but don’t talk too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yassir. Dis way, ladies an’ gempmun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a beautiful walk, through the Autumn
sunshine and forest shade. Now they crossed
a tiny brook or paused to admire a misty waterfall,
and again they found a long stretch of
good State road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And sooner than any one expected, they
reached the shack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s de place,” announced Bobbink, and
stood, pointing to the dilapidated shanty at the
side of the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’ll go in first?” asked Patty; “I’m
scared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not,” and Daisy stepped nearer and
peered curiously in at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, woman!” said a strange, cracked
old voice, and there followed a laugh like a
cackle. “Come in, each and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy pushed in and Farnsworth stepped in,
too, for he didn’t altogether like the sound of
that laugh. Then they all crowded in and
saw the old hermit, sitting in a hunched-up
position on a pile of rugs in the corner of the
hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which one first?” he muttered; “which
pretty lady first? All have fortunes, wonderful
fortunes coming to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man’s garb was somewhat like that
of a monk. A dingy robe was girdled with a
hempen rope, and a cowl-shaped hood fell well
over his brow. His face was brown and seamed
and wrinkled with age, and he wore queer-looking
dark glasses. On his hands were old
gloves that had once been white, but were now
a dingy grey, and he seemed feeble, and unable
to move without difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was alert, doubtless spurred by the
hope of getting well paid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go first, Daisy,” said Patty; “then
we’ll see how it works.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’m not afraid,” and Daisy extended
her palm to the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, wait!” she cried; “don’t touch me
with those dirty old gloves! Can’t I wrap my
handkerchief round my hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hermit made no objection, and Daisy
wound a fresh handkerchief about her fingers,
leaving the palm exposed for the seer to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began, in a droning voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty lady, your home is far away. You
are not of this end of the country, but off
toward the setting sun. You will return there
soon, and there you will meet your fate. He
awaits you there, a man of brain and brawn,—
a man who has ambition to become the mayor
of——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” cried Daisy, snatching her hand
away from his gloved fingers; “Don’t you say
another word! That’s a secret! I don’t want
any more fortune! That man’s a wizard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy moved across the room, putting all the
distance possible between her and the seer.
With startled eyes, she gazed at him, as at a
world wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! That was a chance shot, Daisy,”
said Elise. “Let me try, I’ve no secrets that
I’m afraid he’ll reveal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was she afraid of the grimy old glove,
but put her finger tips carelessly into the old
fellow’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty lady heart-whole,” declared the hermit.
“Some day pretty lady fall in love, but
not today. Some ’nother day, too! Pretty lady
marry twice, two times! Ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly!” said Elise, blushing a little, as she
withdrew her hand. “I hate fortune telling.
Next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty, a little reluctantly, surrendered her
hand to the seer, who took it lightly in his own.
“Pretty lady all upset,” he began. “So many
suitors, all want pretty lady. But the fates have
decree! The lady must marry with the—”
he drew his hand across his eyes,—“I cannot
see clearly! I see a cat! Ha, no! I have it!
the pretty lady must marry with the Kit, ha,
yes; the Kit!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Patty, laughing,
“have I really got to marry Kit! Kit who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That the wizard cannot tell. Only can I
read the name Kit. It is written in the lady’s
fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But s’pose I don’t want to? S’pose I don’t
like Kit as much as somebody else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes nothing! It is fate. It may
not be denied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all right. But I don’t care so much
about my future husband. He’s a long way
off. Tell me what will happen to me before he
arrives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many adventures. You will today receive
a letter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness, I get letters every day! Any
particular letter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a letter from one you love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Daddy, I expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, ’tis a younger man than your honourable
parent. Then, soon the pretty lady will
inherit fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, that’s more interesting. Big fortune?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,—my, yes! Large amount of moneys!
And a journey,—a far journey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care about the journey. Tell me
more about the fortune. Who will leave it to
me? Not my father, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, no near relative.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good; I don’t want my people to die.
Well, anything more, Mister Hermit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beware of a dark lady——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I know you’re the real thing!” and
Patty laughed merrily. “I’ve been waiting
for the ‘dark lady’ and the ‘light-complected
gentleman’ who always figure in fortunes.
Well, what about the dark lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the pretty miss makes the fun, there is
no more fortune for her,” said the hermit,
sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind, so long as you don’t take the
money away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell mine, then,” said Channing, as Patty
resigned her place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, sir, are an acrobat. You were employed
in the Big Circus, the Hop—Hippodrome.
When they discharged you, it was but
temporary. Do not fear, you will regain your
position there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you old wiz! How did you know
that!” and Channing stared in pretended
amazement; “I thought that episode in my career
was a dead secret!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No episodes are secrets to me,” declared
the hermit. “Shall I tell further?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I guess that will be about all,” and
Channing moved quickly away from the strange
old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bob Peyton declined to have his past exposed
to the public gaze; and he said he didn’t care
to know what the future held for him, he’d far
rather be surprised at his life as it happened.
So Bill Farnsworth was the next to test the
wizard’s powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Big man,” said the hermit, solemnly, as he
scanned the broad palm Bill offered for inspection.
“Big man, every way; body, heart, soul,—all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Farnsworth, “for the expansive
if ambiguous compliment. Be a little more
definite, please. What am I going to have for
dinner today? Answer me that, and I’ll believe
in your wizardry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Big man is pleased to be sarcastic. The hermit
does not waste his occult powers on foolish
questions. In a few hours you will know what
you will have for dinner. Why learn now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, indeed? All right, old chap, tell me
something worth while, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will I, sir! I’ll tell you your fate in
wedlock. You will yet wed a lovely lady, who,
like your noble self, is of the Western birth.
She is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drop it, man! Never mind what she is!
Let me tell you what you are! Friends, behold
Mr. Kit Cameron!” With a swift movement,
Farnsworth drew off the old gloves from the
hand that held his, and exposed the unmistakable
slim white hands of the musician, Kit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you fraud!” cried Patty. “I half suspected
it all the time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t,” exclaimed Daisy. “You fooled
me completely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my fortune!” wailed Elise. “Where
are those two lovely fates of mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And all my money!” groaned Patty. “I feel
as if you had misappropriated my funds, Kit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had not been necessary further to remove
Cameron’s disguise, it was enough to see his
hands, and hear his merry laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hist!” cried Peyton, who had looked out
along the road. “Here come Roger and
Mona. Let’s give them a song and dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kit drew on his old gloves again, and huddled
into his crouched posture, just as the two came
in at the hut’s door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just in time!” said Channing. “We’ve all
had our fortunes told and were just about to
go home. Take your turn now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like to,” said Mona, who was looking
very happy and was blushing a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keen-eyed Kit spied this. “Pretty lady,” he
began, in his droning tones, and as he also had
a slight knowledge of ventriloquism, he most
effectually disguised his own voice, “give me
your little hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, Mona, we all did,” said Patty, and
wonderingly, Mona held out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never saw I the future so plainly revealed!”
declared the seer. “’Tis written as
in letters of fire! Lady, thy fate is sealed. It
is bound up with that of a true and noble knight,
a loving soul, a faithful comrade. I see the
blush that mantles your rosy cheek, I see the
trembling of your lily hand, I see the drooped
eyelashes that veil your dancing eyes, and I
see, stretching far into the future, years of happiness
and joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kit released Mona’s hand, and the girls
crowded round her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he mean?” Daisy cried; “he
spoke so in earnest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay!” and the seer raised his hand. “Now
will I tell the fortune of the noble gentleman
who but now arrived. Your hand, fair sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish!” said Roger, disinclined for the
performance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, Farry,” said Farnsworth, smiling.
“We all did. Go ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger gave over his hand, and the hermit
rocked back and forth in glee. “Another clear
writing of the fates!” he exclaimed. “I read
of a happy future with the loved one. I read
that only just now, within the hour, has the Fair
said ‘yes’ to repeated pleadings, and the betrothal
took place,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say!” and Roger tried to pull his hand
from the hermit’s grasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Tis a fair tale I read,” went on the wizard,
holding fast the hand he read; “two young
hearts, made for each other, plighted by the
singing brook—in the balmy sunshine—in a
bower of roses by Bendemeer’s stream—oh,
hang it, old chap, let me be the first to congratulate
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kit flung off his cowl with one hand, while
with the other he gripped Roger’s in a man-to-man
grasp, and shook it heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was a small-sized pandemonium!
The girls fell on Mona, kissing her and asking
questions, while the men joined hands in a sort
of war dance round Roger. Then they all
made a circle round the engaged pair, and sang
“Oats, Peas, Beans, and Barley Grows,” with
the zest of a crowd of children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly gorgeous! I think,” cried Patty,
as the excitement calmed down a little. “I
sort of hoped it would be so, but I didn’t expect
it quite so soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither did I,” said Mona, shyly: “but,
you see——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, we see,” said Kit. “The picturesque
spot,—the murmuring brook,—the whispering
trees,—why, of course, you couldn’t
help it! Bless you, my children! and now, I
want somebody to go out and get engaged to
me. Who will volunteer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not today, Kit,” said Patty, laughing. “Let
troubles come singly for once. Today for this,
tomorrow for yours. Come on, people, I can’t
wait to get home and tell Adele!”</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap8'></a>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>A RIDE TOGETHER</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span>dele was duly surprised and pleased
to learn that Mona and Roger were engaged
and declared they should have an
announcement dinner that very night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s make it a real party,” said Patty,
“with a dance afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As if we didn’t dance every night,” said
Elise, laughing. “But it will seem more like
a party if we put on our best frocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And decorate the table,” added Daisy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the girls put their heads together to see
what they could do in the way of effective and
appropriate decoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might give her a shower,” suggested
Marie, after Mona had left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of a shower? What could we
buy and where could we buy it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s that little bazaar down in the village,
but there’s nothing decent there,” said
Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” agreed Marie, “and we don’t want
to give Mona cheap little gimcracks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we can’t have a shower, that’s out of
the question,” declared Daisy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I <span class='it'>want</span> to have a shower,” persisted
Patty; “it will be no fun at all to give her a
shower after we get back to New York. I’m
going to invent some way to give it to her
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there isn’t any way——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there is, Daisy; now listen. Suppose we
each give her some pretty trinket or thing of
our own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! Worn out old things!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not! But I’ve a little pearl
ring that Mona likes awfully well, and I care
a lot for it myself, too. So I think it would be
a nice gift, just because I <span class='it'>do</span> like it myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good idea, Patty,” said Adele; “I
have a white and silver scarf that Mona just
raves over. It’s Egyptian, you know, and of
some value. I think she’d like these things that
we have personally used, quite as well as new
things. You know Mona can buy anything she
wants, but this personal note would touch her,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you’re right,” Daisy said, thoughtfully.
“I’ve an exquisite lace handkerchief I’d
like to give her. It’s one that was given to my
mother by a French Princess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Daisy, you don’t want to give that up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do. I’m fond of Mona, and I’m
glad for her to have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a lovely fan,” Elise said, “do you think
she’d care for it? It’s one of Duvelleroi’s,—signed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’d love it! We’ll have a wonderful
shower. What have you, Marie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t think of anything worth while. Oh,
yes, I have a centrepiece I’m embroidering for
Christmas. It’s a beauty, and I can finish it
this afternoon, or, if I don’t get it quite done,
I can give it to her unfinished and put in the
last stitches tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Capital!” and Patty smiled at the success
of her “shower” plan. “What do you think,
Chick?” she went on, as that individual, never
very far from Patty’s side, sauntered in, “we’ve
the loveliest scheme!” And she told him of
the shower. “I suppose you boys can’t be in
it, for Mona wouldn’t want a jack-knife or pair
of sleeve-links. And men don’t shower engaged
girls anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I suppose not. But what’s the matter
with us men showering old Farrington? I’ll
bet he’d love to be showered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do!” and Patty clapped her hands.
“Just the thing! Give him funny gifts, will
you, Chick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will. And I’ll make the others
come across, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after luncheon, Patty had a telephone
call which proved to be from Maude Kent.
She begged Patty to come over to the hotel
where she was, at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t,” said Patty. “We’re getting
up a party for Mona, she’s just gone and got
herself engaged to Roger Farrington, and
we’ve got to do something about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can come over for a short time.
Truly, it’s most important. Chick will whiz
you over in a motor, and you can be back in two
or three hours. What time is the party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not till dinner time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then come on. I want you terribly, and
you’d want to come if you knew what for. I
can’t tell you on the telephone, it’s a secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chick was passing, and Patty beckoned to
him. “Will you chauff me over to see
Maude?” she asked, as she still held the receiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the ends of the earth, if you’ve the
slightest desire to go there, my lady fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all right, Maude. I’ll come, but only
for a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do we start, queen of my heart?” and
Channing bowed before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a few minutes. I’ll scoot and dress, and
you meet me here at three sharp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your word is my bond. I’ll be on deck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty flew to her room and rang for the treasure
of a Sarah. The girl was rapidly becoming
a deft ladies’-maid, and when Patty merely
said, “Rose Crêpe, Sarah,” she took from the
wardrobe the pretty afternoon gown of rose-coloured
crêpe de chine, and went at once to
get silk stockings and slippers to match, as well
as the right hat, veil, and accessories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On time, Patty stood again in the hall. Channing
appeared, and at the same time Kit Cameron
strolled in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Kit,” said Patty, “however <span class='it'>did</span> you
think of that crazy scheme of fortune telling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brain is full of nonsense, Patty, and
sometimes it strikes out like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But about my fortune? Did you just make
it all up out of the solid? Or was there
any——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Car’s ready, Patty,” interrupted Channing.
“Leave that investigation till we come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to,” and Patty looked from
one of the men to the other. “I want to hear
about it now. I say, Kit, you drive me, instead
of Chick, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, now, that isn’t fair!” and Channing
looked decidedly annoyed. “You promised
me, Patty——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t. I asked you. That’s quite
different from promising. Now, don’t sulk,
and I’ll give you an extra dance tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, yes, two, then, you greedy boy. Now
run away and play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is this all right?” said Kit, as he hesitated
to take Channing’s place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem so to me,” Chick retorted,
“But what Miss Fairfield says, goes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned on his heel, very much out of sorts
at Patty’s perverse ways, and as she saw the
look on his face and the uncertainty on Kit’s
countenance, Patty broke into a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going, Patty?” said Farnsworth,
coming out of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over to Poland Spring House, if I can get
anybody to drive me. These boys are both
unwilling. You drive me, Little Billee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth looked at her a moment, with the
expression of one who can scarcely believe his
own ears. Then, just as Kit began to exclaim
in indignation Big Bill took his place beside
her and started the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What possessed your kind heart to give me
this pleasure?” he said, and his voice was so
gentle it took from the words all suggestion of
sarcasm or satire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The others were so tiresome. I don’t think
it’s such a favour to allow a man to drive a car
for you. Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It depends on the man and the one who
grants the favour. To me this is a decided
boon. Do you realise, little girl, I never get a
word with you nowadays? You never allow
it. You’re so wrapped up in Channing and
Cameron, you’ve no eyes or ears for any one
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Little Billee, what a taradiddle! But
when people don’t believe what people say,
people can’t expect people to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait! So many people get me all mixed
up! And I do believe you, always. If I
doubted your word about that telephone, it
was because I was misinformed. You see——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, tell me how it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was thoroughly enjoying herself. She
had Big Bill where she wanted him, apologising
for his abominable disbelief in her veracity.
“Tell me who told you stories about me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not stories, exactly. I wanted the long distance
telephone that night, and when I went to
the desk, the telephone clerk said you were
using it, talking to a Mr. Van Reypen, and
would I wait till you finished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And of course you thought I called Phil,
whereas he called me! All right, Billee Boy,
you’re forguv.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then, he called you again, last night. Is
this a habit of his?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Billee, that’s just what I asked him.
But how did you know he telephoned last
night? Clerk again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was in the office, and as you weren’t home,
and the New York call might have been from
your father, I answered. It was Van Reypen,
and as he wanted to know where you were,
of course I told him. Patty, what <span class='it'>did</span>
he want? <span class='it'>Why</span> does he telephone you every
night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let me see what he did want. He telephoned
last night, I believe, to apologise for
telephoning the night before!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What nonsense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he did! Don’t you disbelieve me
again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, I won’t. All right, then, what
did he say the first night, that he had to apologise
for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, fiddlestrings, Billee, it was nothing of
any consequence. I may as well tell you,
though, he just wanted to be invited up here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he <span class='it'>did</span>, did he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he <span class='it'>did</span>, did he! And I told him,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Patty, what did you tell him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty turned her pretty head, and smiled full
in Farnsworth’s face. Her blue eyes were
sparkling, her golden curls were tossed by the
wind, her red lips wore a roguish expression,
as she said, “I just told him I didn’t want
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty! Did you really?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sure did, Little Billee, but it wasn’t quite
true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, really, I <span class='it'>did</span> want him,—a
little oh, only a <span class='it'>very</span> little,—but I knew <span class='it'>you</span>
didn’t and so I told him <span class='it'>I</span> didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty! what a torment you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s eyes opened wide. “Well, I like that!
A torment! Because I headed him off for the
simple reason that you don’t want him! If
that torments you, I’ll telephone him tonight to
come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there, Blue Eyes, take it easy. <span class='it'>I</span>
don’t want him, and <span class='it'>you</span> don’t want him,
and <span class='it'>we</span> won’t have him! Now, let it go at
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Big Bill smiled down happily at the flower-face
that at first looked up at him a little angrily,
and then smiled back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, Peaches, the Van Reypen incident
is closed. Next, will you kindly tell me
why you went in so strong for the Kent lady’s
concert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two reasons, Billee,” said Patty, calmly.
“First, and I hope most, because I was sorry
for her, and wanted to help her out in her
trouble. And second,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, because I’m a silly, vain thing, and I
wanted to sing in public, and have people think
I was Madame Thingamajig, and I like to have
my voice praised,—and I’m just a little idiot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Wil-yum Farns-worth! Aren’t you
ashamed of yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not half so ashamed as you ought to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a crime to be vain of your accomplishments,
and I owned up I was silly. Do
you hate silly people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes, not always. But look here,
Patty, seriously, you don’t want to be intimate
with Maude Kent. She may be a nice girl, all
right, but she has been an actress, and that is
not the sort of people for you to associate
with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you don’t know her very well, Bill;
she is a noble self-sacrificing spirit, and she devotes
her life to earning a living for herself
and her mother and sister. I never knew a
more devoted daughter and sister, than she
is, and I adore her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth sighed. “I feared you’d fly off
like that, Patty. You’re so susceptible and impressionistic.
But you must know that she is
not the sort of girl you’ve been accustomed to
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the worse for the sort of girl I
know, then. Idle, unoccupied creatures, thinking
of nothing but the fleeting pleasures of the
hour! Maude Kent is worth a dozen of them,
when it comes to nobility of purpose and energy
of attainment. What do you know about her,
Bill, that <span class='it'>isn’t</span> admirable?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only that, Patty. That she has been on the
vaudeville stage. I met her personally only
two or three times, and I took little interest in
her. But I hate to see you grow fond of her.
Are you going to see her today?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am. But you need not see her. You can
wait for me in the hotel parlour. I’m sorry I
brought you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you’re not, you’re glad. And I’ll not
wait in any parlour. I’m going with you all the
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, Patty felt relieved, for
she had no idea of what Maude wanted, and
she feared it might be to sing again. This she
had no intention of doing. Once was quite
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached the hotel, they sent up
their names, and Miss Kent came down. She
received them in a small reception room, where
they could be alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember Mr. Farnsworth?” said
Patty, after she had greeted Maude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, very well. I’m so glad to see
you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surely no one could criticise the gentle manner
and soft voice, and Bill Farnsworth looked
at her more kindly than he had intended to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, what’s it all about?” asked
Patty, when they were seated. “For, Maude,
I must not stay but a few minutes. It’s the
night of the announcement party, and I’ve a
lot to do for the affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, I’ll tell you in a few words. Mr.
Stengel, the manager, heard you sing here last
night, and he wants an interview with you, with
an idea of your going on the stage in light
opera.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” and Patty looked amazed, while
Farnsworth bit his lips to restrain what he
wanted to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; he says you have a delightful voice,
but more than that, you have charm and a
decided ability to make good in the parts for
which he should cast you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Maude, you must be crazy, to think
for a minute that I’d consider such a proposition!
I wouldn’t dream of it, and I couldn’t
do it, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you could. And I knew you’d feel this
way, at first, but after you think it over——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Kent,” and Farnsworth’s tones were
cold and incisive, “I know Miss Fairfield and
her people quite well enough to speak with authority
in this matter, and I assure you it is
worse than useless for you to suggest such a
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew it <span class='it'>would</span> strike you so at first, Mr.
Farnsworth, and perhaps Patty’s parents also.
But I feel sure that if it were properly put before
them——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Kent,” and Farnsworth rose, “there
is no way of properly putting it before them.
They would not even listen. And now I must
ask you to excuse us. Come, Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Bill,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come Patty, at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must you obey him?” asked Miss Kent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She must,” said Farnsworth, sternly.
“Come, Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must,” said Patty, and with a strange
look in her eyes, she rose. “I’ll see you again
about this, Maude,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll never see you again, about this, or
anything else,” Farnsworth declared, and his
face was set and his voice hard. “Good day,
Miss Kent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon, Mr. Farnsworth. <span class='it'>Au revoir</span>,
Patty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two started home in silence. Patty’s
mind was full of conflicting emotions. The
idea of going on the stage was so ridiculously
unthinkable as to be of no importance, but the
fact that she had been asked to do so filled
her with a strange pride and satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after a long time that Farnsworth
said, gently, “Patty, you’re so <span class='it'>many</span> kinds of
a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” and Patty sighed, partly from relief
that he wasn’t going to scold and partly
because she agreed with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you see why I didn’t want you to have
anything to do with that Kent woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t see as she has done me any
harm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t? Why, she has put that fool idea
into your head. And you’ll let it simmer and
stew there until you begin to think that maybe
it <span class='it'>would</span> be nice to go on the stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Billee, I wouldn’t do any such a thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not <span class='it'>now</span>, but after you mull over it, and
especially if she ever gets hold of you again,
which pray heaven, she never will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness me! Little Billee, how would I
look on the stage? Why, I’d be lost among
all the big girls they have nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d <span class='it'>look</span> all right, that’s the worst of it.
Now, see here, Patty, make me a solemn promise,
will you? Not that you won’t go on the
stage, but that if you ever <span class='it'>think</span> of doing so,
you’ll tell me first. Will you promise me that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Patty promised.</p>

In every way it was made to seem like
a formal party and not just the gathering
of the clans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adele received the guests in the ballroom, with
Mona by her side. Adele was gorgeous in her
best evening gown, a rose-coloured velvet, and
Mona, in white net, looked like a débutante.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty took especial pains with her toilette,
though it was not entirely necessary, for Patty
looked well in anything. She chose a white
crêpe, whose bewildering masses of tulle
ruchings veiled a skirt of silver lace. The
bodice of silver lace was ruched and draped
with the soft crêpe, and Patty’s pretty throat
and dimpled arms emerged as from a wave of
sea foam. Her golden hair was massed in the
prevailing fashion, caught with two pins of
carved jade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Verra good, Eddie!” Patty remarked to
Sarah, as she viewed her completed self in the
mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss?” said the maid, unfamiliar with
Patty’s nonchalant use of catch phrases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said you done noble,” Patty returned, absently,
as she rearranged the jade pins. She
wore no other ornaments, and catching up a
long floating scarf of white tulle spangled with
silver, she ran downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, remembering the occasion, she made a
most dignified entrance to the reception room,
and bowed exaggeratedly to Adele. “So
pleased!” she murmured, offering her fingertips.
“And Miss Galbraith. May I wish you
all joy and felicity and happiness and
good——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come, Patty, give somebody else a
chance. Don’t babble your good wishes all
night!” She turned to see Kit waiting his turn,
and she laughingly gave way to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it fine to see the men in their evening
togs?” she exclaimed, turning to Elise. “I’m
so used to seeing them in flannels or golf things,
I scarcely recognise them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Do</span> recognise me,” implored Channing,
“I’m the sweet young thing you promised three
extra dances to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three nothing!” returned Patty, carelessly.
“I’m not sure I shall dance tonight, anyway.
I shall spend my time admiring Mona, she
looks so sweet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mona did look sweet. The occasion brought
a look of shyness to her face, which was as
becoming as it was unusual. Roger stood by,
proudly gazing at her, as he was, in turn, congratulated
and chaffed by the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner was announced, and Jim Kenerley offered
his arm to Mona, while Adele followed
the pair with Roger. The orchestra played the
wedding march, and Channing, who stood next
to Patty, escorted her. The rotation of the
table seats had been changed for the occasion,
and Adele and Jim sat opposite one another
with their guests of honour at their right hands.
The others sat where they chose, and Channing
deftly manœuvred to place Patty next to Kenerley,
as he dropped into the chair at her left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s the great little old Machiavelli!”
he said, chuckling. “Didn’t I arrange that
just about right! You see, if I put you next
to Kenerley, you won’t give <span class='it'>him</span> all your undivided
attention, as you would, with any of
the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you aren’t the piggy-wig!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, as far as you are concerned. I cheerfully
admit it. And I’ve practically got you
all to myself for the whole dinner time. You
can’t get away! Oh, joy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is it such a feat? How do you know
that I’m not equally crazy with joy to sit by
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Patty! If I could believe that! What
things you <span class='it'>do</span> say to a fellow! Do you <span class='it'>mean</span>
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Considering I’ve only known you a few days,
I couldn’t really mean it. You see, I make
friendships very slowly. Moreover, I never
mean anything I say at dinner. Table talk is
an art. I’m proficient in it, and I know the
rules. And the first one is, never be sincere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know that, too. But after dinner,
say, out on that moonlit corner of the veranda——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t any moon now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why I refer to it at the dinner table.
I don’t mean it, you see. Well, out in that unmoonlit
corner, then, will you tell me one thing,—tell
me truly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. I’ll tell you two things truly,
even three, if you like. But they must be things
of my own choosing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First, yes. Then it will be my turn. And
I shall ask you something very important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall run away. My mind is so full
of important things just now, that it simply
won’t hold another one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know me yet. I’m a man who
always has his own way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How interesting! I don’t think I ever knew
one before. All the men I have known have
politely deferred to <span class='it'>my</span> way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed? You must be longing for a
change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not only that, but it is positively necessary
that I talk to my other-side man now. Where
are your manners, that you have so long neglected
your other-side lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With thee conversing, I forgot all manners.
Also, the fair Miss Homer is absorbed in Mr.
Peyton’s gay chat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, give her a change, then. Marie,
please turn this way. Mr. Channing is dying
to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marie turned, with a pretty smile, and Patty
gave her attention to Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Jim,” she said, “this is a formal
dinner, and you must observe the fifteen minute
rule. It isn’t like our every-day meals.
Mona, how do you like being guest of honour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a little embarrassed,” said Mona, who
wasn’t at all; “but I’m getting along somehow.
Isn’t Roger splendid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The naïveté of Mona’s gaze at her newly betrothed
made Jim Kenerley chuckle. “You’ll
do, Mona!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The table decorations were as appropriate as
they could be made with little to work with.
Patty had contrived a chime of wedding bells,
of white tissue paper for the centrepiece, and
at each plate was an orange, cored and holding
a few flowers of various sorts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are orange blossoms,” Adele explained;
“though not quite the conventional
style, they show our good intentions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feast went on gaily, and after the dessert,
the shower took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head waiter brought in a tray on which
were the gifts the girls had collected for Mona.
They were beautiful and worth-while things,
and the personal element they represented endeared
them to the pleased recipient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You darling people!” she exclaimed. “You
couldn’t have done anything that would please
me more! It is heavenly kind of you and I
love you for it. I shall use them all, at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Mona slipped Patty’s ring on her finger,
threw Adele’s scarf round her shoulders, and
tucking the wonderful lace handkerchief in her
belt, she waved the fan to and fro. The centrepiece,
which Marie managed to get finished
in time, Mona calmly laid in place under her
own dinner plate, and she declared that she was
perfectly happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, for <span class='it'>our</span> shower,” said Jim. “It isn’t
fair that the bride-elect should get all the loot,
so we take pleasure in presenting to our distinguished,—at
least, distinguished-looking
friend, and fellow-traveller, some few tokens of
our approval of his course. Myself, I offer
these dainty boudoir slippers, knowing that they
will be acceptable, not only for their artistic
merit, but for their intrinsic value. Take them,
Farrington, with my tearful wish for your happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kenerley gave Roger a good-sized parcel,
tied up in tissue paper and ribbons, which, when
opened, disclosed a furiously gaudy and old-fashioned
pair of “worsted-work” slippers.
He had unearthed them at the bazaar in the village,
where they had doubtless been on sale
since the early eighties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody laughed at the grotesque things,
but Roger, in the mood of the moment, made
a gay and graceful speech of thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Bob Peyton presented a smoking set.
This was an impossible affair, of “hand-painted”
china. The ash tray bore the cheerful
motto of “ashes to ashes!” and the tobacco
jar was so clouded with artistic smoke
wreaths, that Kit declared it ought to be labelled
“Dust to Dust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cameron’s gift was a tie case. Evidently
fashioned by feminine fingers, it was of pink
silk, a little faded, embroidered with blue forget-me-nots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tasty, isn’t it?” said Kit, holding it up for
general admiration. “I hesitated a long time
between this and a sponge bag. The other
would be more useful, but there’s something
so fetching about this,—that I couldn’t get
away from it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let <span class='it'>me</span> get you away from it, Cameron,”
said Roger; “I’d hate to deprive you of
anything you admire so sincerely. Take it from
me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Roger,” said Kit, firmly. “I cannot
take it from you. I give it to you,—a little
grudgingly, ’tis true,—but I give it. I may
never have another chance to make you an announcement
shower, and so, on this ’spicious
’casion, I stop at nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a noble fellow, Cameron,” and
Roger’s voice was surcharged with emotion of
some sort. “I accept your gift in the spirit in
which it is given, and I trust I may some day
have the opportunity to shower you in return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope to goodness you will, Farrington,
and I now thank you in advance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Postpone those thanks, please,” broke in
Channing; “your time’s up. I say, Old Top,
here’s the best prize yet. I offer you this picture
frame. But it is no ordinary picture
frame. Observe. It is made of birch bark in
neat pattern, and decorated with real pine
cones, securely glued on. No danger of their
fetching loose, I’ve tested ’em. Now, in this
highly artistic, if a trifle ponderous setting, you
can place Miss Galbraith’s portrait, and wear
it next your heart or dream with it beneath your
pillow. To be sure, it is pretty big and heavy
for either of these uses, but’s what a bit of inconvenience
compared to the sentiment of the
thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing held out an enormous and cumbersome
frame of heavy pine cones, glued to a
board back; a fright of a thing, made by some
of the native country people. As a matter of
fact, these jesting gifts all came from the little
village shop, where native talent was more in
evidence than good taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavenly!” exclaimed Roger, casting his
eyes toward the ceiling. “Look, Mona, is it
not a peach? Will you give me a miniature of
your sweet face to grace it? Oh, <span class='it'>say</span> you will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger’s absurd expression and exaggerated
enthusiasm sent them all off into paroxysms of
laughter, and Mona had no need for reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farrington, old man,” said Bill Farnsworth
then, “brace yourself. I have the best gift yet,
for you. The most appropriate, and combining
a graceful sentiment with a charming usefulness.
Behold!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From voluminous folds of white tissue paper,
Bill shook out an Oriental robe, of gold-embroidered
silk. It was really gorgeous and
looked as if made for a Chinese mandarin.
There were Dragons in raised work and borders
of chrysanthemums. Bill flung it round
Roger, to whose stalwart form the strange
garb was most becoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody exclaimed in admiration. Only
foolish gifts had been looked for and this was
worthy of real praise. The long loose sleeves
hung gracefully down, and the obi or sash
was fringed with silk tassels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A stunning thing!” exclaimed Adele.
“Where <span class='it'>did</span> you get it, Bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“San Francisco,” returned Farnsworth, “but
my heart is broken. You have none of you
noticed the real sentiment, the reason for the
gift. Oh, how dense you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” asked Adele, puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see?” cried Farnsworth. “Where
are your wits? Why should I give that thing
to Farrington, <span class='it'>today</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all looked blank, till suddenly it dawned
on Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Little Billee!” she cried, “oh, you
clever, clever thing! Oh, girls, don’t you see?
It’s a <span class='it'>Ki-Mona</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they did see, and they cheered and complimented
Farnsworth on his witty gift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so clever and so beautiful, I think I
shall take it myself,” Mona declared, and
Roger tossed it over to her. “With all my
worldly goods—may as well begin at once,”
he said with a mock air of resignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shower over, they went to the ballroom to
dance. Of course “Sir Roger de Coverly”
was first on the programme, and after that the
more modern dances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty tried to evade Chick Channing, for he
was growing a bit insistent in his attentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take me for a veranda stroll, Kit,” she
said, as she saw Channing approaching. “I
want you to tell me all about that fortune business.
But first, how did you ever come to think
of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you know my fatal facility for practical
jokes. Come, sit in this palmy bower, and
I’ll tell you all I know, and then some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sauntered in to the pretty glass-enclosed
nook, and sat down among the palms. “You
see,” Kit went on, “I haven’t played a joke in
I dunno when, and I just <span class='it'>had</span> to get one off.
So when I was prowling around, and struck that
empty shack, the idea sprang full-fledged to my
o’er clever brain. I fixed it up with Bobbink,—and
the rest is history. Bobsy is a great boy,
though a little fresh. He got the make-up for
my face, and the rugs and things. He fixed
them all in the old shanty, and then he carried
out the toothache farce in accordance with my
orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he did very well. But I mean about
the fortunes. How did you know about the
man Daisy is so interested in,—the one who
wants to be Mayor of——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sh! that’s a state secret. I know lots of
things, but I keep them to myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Patty, seeing he was in
earnest. “But about somebody leaving me
money. Did you make <span class='it'>that</span> up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not entirely,” and Kit still looked serious.
“Perhaps you will receive a legacy some day.
But did you note what I told you about your
fate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Patty, as she ran away back to
the house.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap10'></a>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>GOOD-BYE, SWEETHEART</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>he days sped all too quickly at Freedom
Castle. And on one golden, shining
September afternoon, Patty realised
that the next day they were all to go home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to go, Billy boy,” she said,
wistfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sitting in a swing that she had herself
contrived, and Chick had achieved for her. It
was a tangle of wistaria vine, pulled down from
the great oak tree that it had climbed, and
fashioned into a loop. This they had decorated
with more sprays of the parent vine itself, and
often Patty, or the others, added autumn leaves
or trailing creepers or bunches of goldenrod or
sumach till the swing was usually a rather
dressy affair. One couldn’t swing far in it, but
then one didn’t want to, and it was a charming
place to sit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Today, Patty, in a chic little suit of tan cloth,
with a white silk blouse and a crimson tie, sat
in the swing, disconsolately poking into the
earth with her patent leather shoe tip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, Patty girl,” and Big Bill looked
regretfully at her. “But you see, the contract
with the servants expires tomorrow, and they
are all anxious to get away. You know, I’ve
staid longer than I intended, now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ’cause I begged you to,” and Patty
smiled at him. “Now if I beg you some more,
will you stay some more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a min-nit! if I possibly could. But it’s
<span class='it'>un</span>-possible. You know I just came up for a few
days to ratify the papers of transference and
see to some business matters, and I’ve all sorts
of important duties beckoning to me with both
hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if I beckon to you with both hands——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty held out her pretty hands, and slowly
beckoned with each slender forefinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tempt me, you little witch. You know
I’d do anything in this world for you, that didn’t
conflict with duty——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you conflict your duty—for me,—Little
Billee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s voice was wheedlesome, and her face
was very sweet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My</span> duty, yes, Patty.” Bill looked stern.
“But my duty to others,—no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Billee-ee-<span class='it'>ee</span>——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, dear, but I must disappoint you.
My employers expect me in Boston tomorrow
night, and I must not fail them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, can’t we stay here, even if you go
away? Jim and Adele could manage things,
and we don’t want servants. We could sort of
camp out. I’m a good cook, and we’d have a
lovely time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth considered. He looked far off
and his fine brows knit as he thought over
Patty’s request. She looked at him and noted
the cloud that came over his blue eyes as he
turned to her, and said: “No, Apple Blossom,
it can’t be done. This place is a trust to me,
in a way, and I’m responsible. I may not leave
it to others. And I cannot remain myself. So
there’s no help for it, I must refuse you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an air of finality about Bill’s tones
that told Patty there was no use in further
coaxing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Patty?” he went on.
“It isn’t like you to tease so. I wish with all
my heart I could give you what you ask, it hurts
me worse than you know to refuse you anything.
But I wouldn’t be worthy of the trust
reposed in me, if I failed in my duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate duty,” said Patty, petulantly; “it’s
a regular nuisance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gently, little girl, gently. What has happened
to stir you up so? It’s more than this
ungratified whim of not staying here longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you think that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think, I know it. Why, Patty dear,
I know every expression of your flower face,
every look in your blue eyes, every droop of
your sensitive mouth. And now it’s drooping
like a—like a, well, more like a perverse baby
than anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth laughed gently as Patty’s mouth
suddenly curved upward in an involuntary
smile, then, as it drooped again, she said; “I
believe I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you think best. I wonder if you remember
a promise you made me once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Little Billee, how did you know it referred
to that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something seemed to hint it to me. Well,
out with it. Are you still stage-struck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but that manager, Mr. Stengel, won’t
give up the idea of putting me on in light opera.
He says——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says? Has he written to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Maude wrote me what he said. Any
way, he thinks I have remarkable talent,
and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t, Patty. Not remarkable talent.
You have a pretty, light-weight voice, and a—h’m—shall
we say an attractive appearance;
but more than that is required for an opera
success, even light opera. Forgive me, Apple
Blossom, I know I am hurting your feelings,
but it’s better you should know the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why does Mr. Stengel want to put me
into his plays?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He thinks you would look graceful and
pretty and would be a drawing card for a time.
Then, when your freshness wore off, as it would
soon, he would throw you over like a worn-out
toy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, <span class='it'>your</span> freshness hasn’t worn off, Bill
Farnsworth,” and Patty stood up, her eyes
dark with anger at his words. “And I don’t
care for any more of your opinions on a subject
you know nothing about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Big Bill Farnsworth smiled. “Well, was it
a little ruffled kitten! Did it hate to be misjudged
and misunderstood and all those horrid
things! Well, then, Patty, see here. I’ll
let you off from your promise to tell <span class='it'>me</span> when
you think of going on the stage, but you must
tell your father. Though I can’t think you
would ever take such a step, without consulting
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s sudden blush and a guilty look in her
eyes made Bill stare at her sharply, and then
he said: “Oh, you <span class='it'>were</span> thinking of just that,—were
you, Patty Fairfield? I can hardly believe
it. You poor little thing, you <span class='it'>must</span> be infatuated!
Is it all that Maude Kent’s doing?
Or, have you—Patty, you haven’t <span class='it'>seen</span> Stengel,
have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” and Patty looked astounded at Bill’s
vehemence. “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank heaven! I thought for the fraction
of a second your infatuation might be for him.
All right. You go home and talk to your father
and your very sensible stepmother, and I’ll warrant
you’ll forget this bee in your bonnet in
pretty short order. And I hope you’ll never
see Maude Kent again. She has a certain
charm and I don’t wonder it appealed to a poor
little innocent like you. Promise, Patty, you’ll
lay the case before your parents, before you
take a further step.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I shan’t go against their wishes,”
Patty spoke with great dignity, “but I know I
can get them to see it as I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed? And just how do you see it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I see a fine and worthy career opening
before me,” Patty scowled as the grin on Bill’s
face grew broader, “a more valuable career
than you are able to appreciate, a more—more——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty! Oh, you angel goose, you! <span class='it'>Do</span>
stop, you’ll finish me!” And Farnsworth threw
back his head and roared with laughter. “And
does this—er—valuable career shape itself to
your clearer vision as being in the front row of
the chorus, or farther back——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill paused, stopped by the look of horror on
Patty’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chorus!” she cried. “Why, you must be
crazy! I shall be a prima donna, one of the
reserved, exclusive ones, that nobody ever
knows much about. I’m not going to have my
picture all over the signboards, I can tell you
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor the ash barrels? Well, for <span class='it'>this</span> relief,
much thanks. Patty, I could laugh at you till
I cried, but I feel more like crying first. I’m
so sorry you’ve got this whimsey, for I know
you’ll hang on to it, like a puppy to a root;
and I shan’t be here to look after you. But
your father will do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, where are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“West again. I don’t know just when, but
very soon. Now, it may be better for you to
have this violently and get over it quicker, like
mental measles. But unless you promise me
faithfully to tell it all,—every word,—to your
father and mother, I’ll write them myself, all
about it. Do you want me to do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chick thinks it would be great fun for me
to have a try at the stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Channing say that?” Bill’s face grew
dark. “Did he, really, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he did. He said I’d make a screaming
hit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chick’s only joking; don’t let him fool you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he wasn’t joking, and you know it. He
thinks, as I do, that such an experience would
broaden me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, stop! Do you want to be ‘broadened’
at the expense of all your refinement,
your loveliness, your dainty girlhood, your fresh
sweet youth,—oh, Patty, my little Patty, listen
to me! If you never speak to me again, if you
scorn me utterly, at least take my word for
this, you must not, you <span class='it'>shall</span> not, think of this
thing! Patty, come to me, instead. Come to
me, dear, let me take care of you, and find
pleasures for you that will make you forget this
foolishness——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not foolishness, but your talk is. I
don’t care to hear any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, dear, wait a moment. You know I
love you, Patty, more than life itself; marry
me, and let me teach you to forget this whim
of yours——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a whim. And I don’t <span class='it'>want</span> to marry
you. This idea of mine is not a whim,—but
a career, a splendid opportunity that calls to
me—that promises wonderful things,—that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty,” and Farnsworth’s face was white,
“is that true,—what you said just now, that
you—you don’t <span class='it'>want</span> to marry me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s true,” and Patty’s angry blue eyes
met his own sad ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, that’s all, Apple Blossom. You may
go now. I’ve no fear that you will do anything
further in this other matter, without your
father’s knowledge and no fear that he will allow
it. So that’s all right. Good-bye—Sweetheart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye,” and Patty flounced off. Yes,
flounced is the word, for angry and chagrined,
she let go of the swing she was holding, with
a quick push, and whirling about, walked
quickly toward the house.</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning the whole party left for
New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s been perfectly lovely,” Adele said to
Farnsworth; “and if it were not for my baby
girlie, I’d like to stay another week. But I
hear her calling me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Boston they were to stay over night. The
party really broke up there, for several of the
men were going in different directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Adele gathered her brood of girls under
her wing and carried them off to a hotel. And
in the hotel lobby good-byes were said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had my long-feared telegram,” said
Farnsworth, “and I have to go to Arizona at
once. Wasn’t it lucky it didn’t come before we
left our happy hunting grounds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed,” said Adele, “it’s been a beautiful
party, Bill, and we just love you for giving
it to us. Don’t we, girls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” they chorused, and laughingly interrupting
their thanks, Farnsworth shook hands
with everybody in hasty farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow, Patty was the last, and as he held
out his hand to her, a gay voice was heard calling
out, “Oh, here you are, people! How do
you all do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked up to see Philip Van Reypen’s
smiling face, as he cordially greeted one after
another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most perfect time,” Mona was saying,
when Daisy caught her up; “Oh, yes, the <span class='it'>most
perfect</span> time! What do you think, Phil, we had
an engagement up there! A real live engagement!
Guess the guilty parties!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess us!” exclaimed Roger, taking Mona’s
hand and looking mock sentimental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no use,” said Daisy, “you can’t get
a rise out of them! They forestall you every
time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Congratulations, all the same,” said Van
Reypen, cordially. “Patty, how are you?
Sunburned? Not very much.” His manner
was so cheery and his chatter so gay, nobody
could be very serious, and the farewells became
short and perfunctory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger and Elise were taking Mona with them
to Newport, where Mrs. Farrington was, and
Bob Peyton was going directly home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Van Reypen, “it’s lucky I came
along, Mrs. Kenerley, to help you care for your
charges. Cameron, you and I must look after
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m on the job, too,” said Channing. “You
can’t shake me till the last bell rings. Your
train time, Farnsworth! So long, old man.
See you when you return. You’re always turning
and returning. And all thanks for a bully
time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, everybody,” cried Bill, in his most
genial way. “Glad you enjoyed it, and hope
we can try it again some time. Good-bye,
Patty,” and with a swift hand clasp, and a quick
look in her eyes, Bill swung off and was lost to
sight in the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something seemed to snap in Patty’s heart.
A cloud swam before her eyes, and she swayed
a little where she stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, girl,” said a strong, calm voice
in her ear, and Van Reypen grasped her elbow
and steadied her. Immediately, she was
ashamed of her passing emotion, and laughed
gaily, as she met his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m here,” he said simply; “you’ll be taken
care of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wherever <span class='it'>did</span> you drop from?” and Patty
suddenly realised the queerness of his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m the little busybody who finds out
things. I found out what train you people
came down on, and I met it. Or rather, I tried
to, but I reached it just as you left the station
for this hostelry, so perforce, I followed you
up. Now, may I attach myself to your cortège,
Mrs. Kenerley? I can make myself useful,
I assure you. Are you staying here over
night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of us are,” replied Adele, who liked
Phil, and was glad to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then be my guests for the evening. We’ll
have dinner in great shape, and do a show,
and just round up Boston generally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Kenerleys agreed, and soon the festivities
began by the party sitting down for afternoon
tea in the hotel tea room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy told Phil of Patty’s escapade enacting
the singer, M’lle Farini.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a lark!” said Van Reypen. “But I
daresay you gave the audience a greater treat
than if the lady herself had been there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure she did!” declared Channing. “I tell
you, we’ll see Patty on the stage yet. And a
charming prima donna she would make, too.
I believe it would be a great success. Farnsworth
says——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But then some interruption occurred and the
sentence was never finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening, they all went to see a new light
opera that was exceedingly popular. It was a
dainty, pretty piece of foolery, full of Dresden
china-looking ladies, and knights in theatrical
armour, and the principal singer was a slight
fairy-like person, much like Patty herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could give that Diva cards and spades,”
declared Chick, as they discussed her at an after
theatre supper. “Why, Patty, you’re more
of an actress than she is, this minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a thousand times better-looking,” said
Philip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill Farnsworth says I’m good-looking
enough,” began Patty, slowly, and then she
stopped short and changed the subject. She
wanted to think it out for herself, before there
was any more talk about it. So, if any one recurred
to the matter, she quickly spoke of something
else, and the evening passed merrily
away.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap11'></a>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>A BUBBLE BURST</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>O</span>ne afternoon, about a week later, Philip
Van Reypen called at the Fairfields
home in New York. Being informed
that Patty was out, he asked to see Mrs. Fairfield,
and Nan received him in the library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So sorry Patty isn’t here,” she said, as she
greeted him cordially. “She’ll be sorry, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it’s just as well,” returned Philip.
“I’d like a little talk with you. Look here,
Mrs. Nan, has Patty said anything to you about
going on the stage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless you mean a Fifth Avenue stage, she
certainly has not,” and Nan smiled at the idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t laugh, it’s serious. You know I
met the crowd coming down from Maine, at
Boston, and I was with them one evening.
Well, they talked,—jestingly, it’s true,—but
they talked about Patty being in light opera
some time,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Philip, how perfectly ridiculous! It
was entirely a joke, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so. It seems, as near as I can
make out, that Farnsworth put her up to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill Farnsworth! Oh, I can’t think he
would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Patty herself said to me that Farnsworth
said she was good-looking enough, and
then, somehow, she got mixed up with a singing-person
of some sort, who used to be an
actress. Farnsworth knew her in San Francisco,
I believe. And she infatuated Patty to
such an extent that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard such nonsense! Why hasn’t
Patty told me all this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just the point. If there were nothing
to it, she would have told you. That’s why
I fear she has taken the notion seriously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t think it yet. I’ll ask her when she
comes home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure that would be wise. Why
don’t you wait, and see if she does anything in
the matter. Elise Farrington said that a manager
had asked to see Patty regarding the subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A manager!” Nan fairly gasped. “Why,
this is awful! What would her father say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But wait a minute, let’s look at the thing
rationally. You know how susceptible Patty is
to a new idea or a new influence. I think this
ex-actress had bewitched the child, and to chide
her would only make her more determined to
stand by her new friend. Why not deal more
diplomatically. Watch Patty, and if she does
anything queer or inexplicable, follow it up, and
see what it means. Of course, you know, Mrs.
Nan, that I’m actuated only by honest interest
in Patty’s welfare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know that, Philip; and I’m very glad
you came to me with this story first. Perhaps
it won’t be necessary to speak of it to Mr. Fairfield,
at least, not yet. He’s busy, and a little
bothered just now with some business matters;
and if I could straighten out this foolishness
without letting it worry him, I’d be glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll do it,” and Phil spoke heartily. “We’ll
save that little goosie from herself. Of course,
you know, I worship the ground she walks on,
and I’m going to win her yet. You think I’ve a
chance, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why not, Phil. There’s nobody
I’d rather see Patty marry than you, but she
is determined she won’t listen to such a thing
yet. She says she has too much fun being a
belle, to tie herself down to any one man. And
perhaps she is right. She’s only twenty, and
while that’s quite old enough to marry, if she
wants to, yet it’s young enough to wait a while
if she prefers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite agree to that. It’s only that I want
to be on the spot when she does make up her
mind to marry. Of course she will, eventually.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. And you have every chance.
Now, as to this other matter, do you think Mr.
Farnsworth instigated the idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gathered that from different things that
were said. And the actress person was his
friend. And I know that he took Patty over
to Poland Spring House to see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s her name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kent,—Maude Kent. They call her
Maudie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Queer Patty hasn’t mentioned her. I agree
with you, that looks as if she took the thing
seriously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, perhaps not,” and Philip rose to go.
“It may be I exaggerate the danger. But I’m
so fearful of that capricious nature of hers,—you
never can tell what whim she’ll fly at
next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true, and I’m so much obliged to you
for putting me on my guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan said nothing to her husband on this subject,
but she watched Patty more carefully.
She was clever enough not to let the supervision
be apparent, but it was unremittent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, nothing transpired to rouse her suspicions
in any way. Patty was her own gay,
sunny self, planning all sorts of gaieties and employments
for the winter season. She had by
no means given up or neglected her club, that
was for the purpose of giving pleasure to
shop-girls or other working women, and she
thought up plans for raising money for that
philanthropic purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kept up her membership in the Current
Events Club and in the Musical Society to
which she belonged, and she showed no undue
interest in the new light operas that were successively
put upon the stage. She attended
most of these, but she had always had a liking
for them and that did not seem to Nan a special
indication of histrionic intent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But one evening, as the three Fairfields sat
at dinner, Patty was called to the telephone.
She left the table and after a time returned with
sparkling eyes and rosy cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear people,” she said, smiling at her parents,
“I’ve a surprise to spring on you. Will
you be astounded to learn that your foolish
little Patty had a chance to make good in the
world? To have a career that will mean fame
and celebrity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan almost choked. An icy hand seemed to
clutch at her throat. The hour had struck,
then. And with all her watchfulness she had
not succeeded in preventing it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It perfectly wonderful,” Patty was rattling
on, “you can hardly believe it,—I hardly can,
myself, but I’m going to be a great singer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re that now, Kiddie,” said her father,
who had no idea of what lay back of this introduction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but more than that! Oh, Nan, it’s too
glorious! Daddy, what <span class='it'>do</span> you think? I’m
going to sing in light opera!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve often done that,” he returned, thinking
of her amateur performances. “One of
your favourite Gilbert and Sullivan ones, or
more modern this time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty laughed happily. “You don’t get it yet,
Dadsy. I mean in a real opera, on the real
stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Just say that again! My old ears
must be failing me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to be a real prima donna! On
the stage of a real theatre!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if I see you first. But elucidate this
very extraordinary statement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will.” But even as she began to speak,
Patty caught sight of Nan’s face, and the lack
of sympathy, nay, more, the look of positive
disapproval she saw there, made her pause a
moment. Then she went on, a little defiantly,
“I suppose it will strike you queer at first, but
you’ll get used to it. Why, Dads, I found out,
while I was up in Maine——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down in Maine,” corrected her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, any old way to Maine, but I discovered
that I have a voice! and more, I have a
knack, a taste, a talent, even, for the stage.
And,—I’m going to devote my life to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Devote your life to it!” And Mr. Fairfield’s
tone was scathing. “If you’re so anxious for
a life of devotion, I’ll put you in a convent.
But on the stage! Not if the Court knows herself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty smiled tolerantly. “I was afraid you’d
talk like that at first. It shall now be my duty
and my pleasure to make you change your intelligent
mind. Nan, you’ll help me, won’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty asked this with some misgiving, for Nan
did not look entirely helpful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help you to go on the stage?” was the
smiling retort, for Nan quickly decided to keep
the discussion in a light key, if possible. “Yes,
indeed, after some reputable physician has
signed a certificate of your lunacy,—but <span class='it'>not</span>
while you’re in your right mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Nancy, don’t go back on me! I depend
on you to talk father over, though he
won’t need much argument, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Patty,” and her father spoke
seriously; “tell me just what you’re driving
at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only this, Dad. I’ve a chance to go on
the stage in a new light opera and I want to
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose opera?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean the composer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not. I mean the manager or owner, or
whoever is getting you mixed up with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the manager is Mr. Stengel——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stengel! Why, Patty, he’s a—a <span class='it'>real</span> manager!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I said,” and Patty beamed at
him. “And he is coming here tonight to see
me,—to see <span class='it'>us</span> about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, don’t be so overcome. You didn’t
know your little goose girl would turn out a
swan, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’s a misapprehension somewhere.
You see, Mr. Stengel is <span class='it'>not</span> coming here tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he is, I’ve just telephoned that he
might.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You telephoned Stengel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, not directly to him, but I told
my friend, Miss Kent, that she might bring
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who? What friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Kent. I met her up—down in Maine.
She’s a musical—oh, Daddy Fairfield, <span class='it'>don’t</span>
look as if you’d been struck by lightning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have, and I’m trying to crawl out from
under the débris. Now the first thing you do,
my child, you fly back to that telephone, and
call off that little engagement for this evening.
Tell your Maine friend that circumstances over
which you have <span class='it'>no</span> control make it impossible
for you to receive her and the illustrious manager
this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Father,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At once, Patty, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fairfield spoke in a tone that Patty had
not heard since she was a little girl, but she
well remembered it. She rose without a word
and did as she was bid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be very gentle with her, Fred,” Nan
murmured, as soon as Patty was out of hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” and Mr. Fairfield flashed a glance
of amused understanding at his wife. “Did
you know about this thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only vaguely. I’ll tell you some other time.
But quash the scheme decidedly, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Rather!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty came back, her face a little flushed, her
lips a little pouting, but quite evidently ready
for the fray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did as you told me, Father,” she began,
“but I think you’ll be sorry for the stand
you’ve taken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps so, girlie, but I don’t want my sorrow
to interfere with my digestion. So let’s
drop the whole subject till after dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had always been a rule in the Fairfield
household never to discuss unpleasant subjects
at table. So Patty tacitly agreed and during
the rest of the meal there was only gay conversation
on light matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, then,” said Mr. Fairfield, when dinner
was over, and the three were cosily settled
in the pleasant library, “tell me over again
and tell me slow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, quietly, but still with that air of determination,
Patty told about Maude Kent, and
the concert at Poland Spring and how Mr.
Stengel was interested and wanted to see her
with a view to starring her in light opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fairfield sighed, for he foresaw no easy
task in trying to persuade his wilful daughter to
his own point of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, dear,” he said, “do you remember
when you were a little girl, I gave you a lecture
on proportion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, Daddy, and I’ve never forgotten it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, put it in practice now, then. Can’t
you see that it is out of all proportion to think
of an ignorant, untrained girl like you stepping
all at once into the rôle of a successful prima
donna?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But more experienced people than you think
I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they don’t, dear. This manager knows
your limitations, he knows you have no stage
lore or experience, and if he wants you, it is
only because of your dainty and charming personality,
and because there is a certain prestige
in the fact of a society girl going on the stage.
But, as soon as the novelty was over, he would
fling you aside like a worn-out glove.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know? You never were a
manager?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, men of experience in this world don’t
have to adopt a profession to know many salient
points regarding it. I shall have to ask you
to take my word that I do know enough of
managers and their ways to know my statement
is true. Nor are the managers altogether
wrong. It is their business to get performers
who interest the public, and they have a right
to use their efforts toward that end. But I
don’t want my daughter to be sacrificed to their
business acumen. Now, will you drop this wild
scheme without further argument, or shall we
thresh it out further?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I’ve no intention of dropping it, Dad,”
and Patty looked amazed at the idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord, then I suppose we must go
through with the farce. All right, go back to
the telephone and have the Stengel man come,
right here and now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I? Oh, Dadsy, I knew you’d give in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give in nothing! I want to show you what
a little ninny you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute,” said Nan, as Patty rose
and walked toward the telephone table; “suppose
we don’t ask Mr. Stengel, at first,—but
just have Miss Kent come and tell us about
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” agreed Mr. Fairfield. “She can’t
come alone,—Patty, tell her we’ll send the car
for her. I’d like to go straight ahead with this
interesting matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty telephoned and Maude Kent said she
would come. The car was despatched and in
a tremor of impatience Patty waited for her
friend’s arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elder Fairfields made no further allusion
to the subject, but talked on other matters till
the guest was announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maude Kent bustled in, and greeted Patty
effusively, kissing her on both cheeks. She acknowledged
introduction to the other two with
gay cordiality, and seated herself in the middle
of a sofa, flinging open her satin evening wrap.
She wore a light-coloured gown, with a profusion
of lace and a great deal of jewelry. Patty
looked at her a little surprised, for she gave a
different impression from the girl she had seen
before. She couldn’t herself quite define the
difference, but Maude seemed less refined,
louder, somehow, here in the Fairfield home,
than she had in the big hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Patty wished she would act more reserved
and less chatty and familiar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Mr. Fairfield,” Maude ran on,
“we just <span class='it'>must</span> have our Patty in the profesh.
We need her, and I assure you she’ll make
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In just what way, Miss Kent?” asked Fred
Fairfield, his keen eyes taking in the visitor’s
every move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she can sing, you know; and she’s a
looker, all right; and she has charm—oh, yes,
decided charm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is this enough, you think, to assure
Mr. Stengel’s giving her, say, a ten-year contract
as a prima donna?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, hardly that!” and Maude laughed,
heartily. “You men will have your little joke.
But he would give her a good place in the
chorus to start with, and doubtless Patty would
work up. Oh, yes, she could work up, I feel
sure. Patty is not afraid of hard work, are
you, dearie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it is as a chorus girl that Mr. Stengel
wishes to engage Patty?” Fred Fairfield’s
voice was quiet, but his eyes shot gleams of indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, Mr. Fairfield; she couldn’t expect
a higher position at first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And would she be assured of having it in
time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she caught on with the public,—or, if Mr.
Stengel took a liking to her personally——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do, Miss Kent. I’m sure you will
forgive me if I decline to pursue this subject
further. My daughter most certainly will not
go into any venture of Mr. Stengel’s, or accept
any other position on the stage. The incident
is closed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in Fred <a id='fair'></a>Fairfield’s face
that forbade the indignant rejoinder Maude
Kent was about to make. And it was with a
sudden accession of dignity that she rose to her
feet and drew her wrap about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” she said; “it is closed. As
a matter of explanation, let me say that my interest
in the thing is a legitimately financial
one. Mr. Stengel gives me a fair commission
on the young ladies I persuade to join his
chorus. As I am self-supporting, this means
something to me. Moreover, I am personally
fond of Miss Fairfield, and I am sorry not to
have achieved the triumph of her consent. But
since it is impossible, I can only bid you all
good evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the air of an offended queen, Maude
Kent swept from the room, and the Fairfield
chauffeur took her back to her home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, you everlasting little goose!” said
Fred Fairfield as he took his daughter in his
arms, “forget it! There’s no harm done, and
nobody need ever know how foolish you were.
Your bubble’s burst, your air castle is in ruins,
but your old father is still here to look after
you, and laugh with you over your ridiculous
schemes. Now, forget this one and start another!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>MIDDY</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“W</span>hither away, Patty?” asked
Nan, as Patty came downstairs one
bright morning in late October,
hatted and gowned for the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going out on multifarious errands.
First, I shall make a certain florist I wot me of,
wish he had never been born. What <span class='it'>do</span> you
think? I ordered pink chrysanthemums and he
sent yellow? Could villainy go further? And
then I’ve some small shopping to do. Any errands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, unless you stop in at the photographer’s
and see if my pictures are done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right I will. By, by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty got into the big car, with its open top,
and drew in long breaths of the crisp autumn
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Morley, the florist’s, first, Martin,” she
told the chauffeur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they drove down Fifth Avenue, Patty
nodded to acquaintances now and then. She
was very happy, for she was planning a pleasant
outing for her club of working girls, and
it greatly interested her. She had long ago
gotten over her foolish notion about the stage,
and was now able to laugh at the recollection
of her silly idea. But she occasionally sang at
a concert for charity or for the entertainment
of her friends, and her voice, by reason of study
and practice, was growing stronger and fuller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she reached Morley’s the florist’s doorman
assisted Patty from the car, and she went
into the shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though she had threatened to reprove him
severely for his error about the flowers, Patty
was really very polite, and merely called his attention
to the mistake, which he promised to
rectify at once. Then, selecting a small bunch
of violets to pin on her coat, Patty went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doorman, who had been looking in the
window, to see when she started, sprang to attention,
and then, as Patty stepped toward her
car, she stood stock-still in amazement. For
there, on the back seat, sat a smiling baby, a
chubby rosy-cheeked child about two years
old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you cunning Kiddy!” exclaimed Patty,
“where in the world did you come from?
What are you doing in my car?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby smiled at her, and holding out a
little white-mittened hand, said: “F’owers?
F’owers for Middy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is she, Martin?” asked Patty of the
chauffeur. “How did she get here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin looked around. The car was a long
one, and he had not turned to look back since
Patty went into the shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Miss Patty, I don’t know! Maybe
some of your friends left her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course, no one would do that, and
besides, I don’t know the child. Who are you,
baby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Middy,” said the little one. “I Middy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are, are you? Well, that doesn’t help
much. Who brought you here, Middy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muddy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muddy, Middy. Your vocabulary seems to
be limited! Well, what shall I do with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby gurgled and smiled and reiterated a
demand for “f’owers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you may have the flowers,” and Patty
gave her the violets, “but I don’t understand
your presence here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently it mattered not to the baby what
Patty understood, and she smelled the flowers
with decided evidences of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty turned to the doorman, who had followed
her from the shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you make of it?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stared. “I don’t know, ma’am.
There was no baby in the car when you arrived
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That there was not,” agreed Patty. “Well,
how did she get there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I’ve no idea, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weren’t you here while I was in the store?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am, but I was looking in at you,
so’s to be ready to open your car door as soon
as you came out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I never heard of anything so queer. I
wonder what I’d better do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I call a policeman, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Policeman? Gracious, no! This is a nice
child. See how pretty she is, and how well
dressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked up and down the street, but
saw no one whom she could connect with the
baby’s presence. A policeman drew near, and
his expression was questioning. He hadn’t realised
that there was a strange baby in the
case, but he saw the lady was in a dilemma
of some sort, and he was about to ask why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Patty jumped in the car beside the child,
and said, “Home, Martin,” so quickly, that
the policeman wandered on without a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s ridiculous to take you home, baby,”
Patty said; “but what can I do with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“F’owers,” said the little voice, and the
stranger offered them to Patty to smell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, nice flowers,” returned Patty, absently,
as she stared hard at her visitor. “Who are
you, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Middy,—des Middy,” and the little face
dimpled in glee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Middy, you’re one too many for
me!” and they went on toward home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Nan!” cried Patty, as she took her new
friend indoors, “look who’s here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is she?” asked Nan, looking up from
her book, as Patty deposited the small morsel
of humanity on a sofa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dunno. She was wished on me while I was
in at Morley’s. Came out of the shop to find
her sitting bolt upright in the car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really? Did somebody abandon her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say. She wasn’t there,—and then, she
<span class='it'>was</span> there! That’s all I know. Want her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not. But what are you going to
do with her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger seemed to sense a lack of
welcome, and putting up a pathetic little
red lip, said in tragic tones. “Middy ’ants
Muddy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor little thing!” cried Patty, catching
her up in her arms. “Did your mother put
you there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ess, Muddy frowed Middy in au’mobile.
Middy ’ant do home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is your home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby’s face smiled beatifically, but the
midget only said “Vere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know yourself?” and the baby
shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s clear enough, Patty, somebody has abandoned
the little thing. How awful! And such
a pretty baby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And beautifully dressed. Look, Nan, see
the little white kid shoes, and fine little handkerchief
linen frock. And her cap is all hand-embroidered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And her coat is of the best possible quality.
Look at the fineness of the cloth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t make it out. If it were a poor
child, I’d think it a case of abandonment. Oh,
Patty, I’ll tell you! Somebody kidnapped a rich
child, and then they became frightened, and
slipped her into your car to save themselves
from discovery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course that’s it! How clever you
are, Nan, to think it out! For she is a refined,
sweet baby, not a bit like a slum child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was true. The dark curls that clustered
on the baby’s brow were fine and soft, her little
hands were well cared for, and her raiment
was immaculate and of the best. But they
searched in vain for any name or distinguishing
mark on her clothes. Even the coat and cap
had no maker’s tag in them, though it was evident
that there had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See,” said Patty, “they’ve ripped out the
store tag! The kidnappers did that. Did the
bad mans take you, baby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Muddy b’ing baby. Des Muddy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Muddy is, of course, her mother. Now,
we know her mother never put the child
in the car, so I guess we can’t depend on her
story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ess,” and the little one grew emphatic.
“Muddy did b’ing Middy. An’ Muddy <span class='it'>did</span>
put Middy in au’mobile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I give it up. She seems to know what
she’s talking about, but I do believe she was
kidnapped. We’ll have to keep her for a day
or two. It’ll be in the papers, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps she’s hungry, Nan; what ought she
to eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything simple. Ask Louise for some milk
and crackers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Middy did not seem hungry. She took
but a sip of the milk and a mere nibble of the
cracker. She seemed happy, and though she
beamed impartially on everybody, she said
little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ought to have something to play with,”
decreed Patty. “There isn’t a thing in the
house. I ransacked the attic rooms for that
last missionary box. I haven’t any favours or
toys left. Nan, I’m going to take her out to
buy some, and maybe we’ll meet her distracted
mother looking for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you won’t! But go along, if you
like. I’ll go with you as far as Gordon’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Putting on the baby’s wraps again, Patty
started off. The child was delighted to go in
the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice au’mobile,” she said, patting the
cushions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear her patronising tone!” laughed Nan.
“Middy have au’mobile at home?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” was the reply as the tiny white
teeth showed in a sunny smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a lovely-natured little scamp, anyway,”
declared Patty, hugging the morsel to
her, and Middy crowed in contentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty took her to a large toyshop. As they
entered, a clerk came forward to wait on them.
“What can I show you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute,” said Patty. “Let the
baby choose. Now, Middy, what do you like
best?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child looked around deliberately. Then,
spying some dolls, she made a rush for them.
“Middy ’ant Dolly-baby! Ess!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, you shall have a dolly-baby. This
one, or this one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. ’Reat bid one! See!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed to the largest doll of all, a very
magnificent affair, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s too big for a little girl like
Middy! Have a dear little, cunning, baby
doll.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, no, the child was self-willed, and insisted
on the big doll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Patty, “I suppose she might
as well have it,” so the big doll was put into
the outstretched little arms, and peace reigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ a dolly vadon,” the small tyrant went
on. This was translated to mean dolly wagon,
by the clerk, who was more versed than Patty
in baby language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious, sister! You’ll bankrupt
me!” and Patty inquired the price of the little
coaches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, the wilful purchaser declined all
but the best and biggest, and when it was ordered
sent home, Patty hurried her charge out
of the store lest she demand further booty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the big doll they went back home, and
Patty set herself to work to get further knowledge
of the child’s antecedents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here efforts were vain. She learned
only the age of her guest and no other statistics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mos’ two ’ears old,” Middy declared she
was, but except for that, no information was
forthcoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inquiries regarding her father brought only
blank looks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you any father at all?” urged
Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; no fader. Poor Middy dot no fader!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the bid for sympathy was so clearly insincere,
and the accompanying smile so merry
that Patty concluded she had no father of her
recollection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It soon transpired that the wily mite called
for sympathy on all occasions. “Poor Middy,”
was her constant plea, if she wanted anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Middy hung’y,” she said at last, and
this time she eagerly welcomed the milk and
crackers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Poor Middy s’eepy,” she announced,
when her meal was over, and willingly she allowed
Patty to bathe her hands and face and
put her to rest on the couch in the living-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever see anything so pretty?” exclaimed
Patty to Nan, as the latter returned.
“She’s been sleeping nearly two hours. See her
little hand, just like a crumpled rose-leaf. What
<span class='it'>will</span> Dad say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They let the baby sit up until Mr. Fairfield’s
arrival, anxious to know his opinion of the
strange circumstance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, bless my soul!” he exclaimed.
“Patty, what queer jinks will you cut up
next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Dads, it surely wasn’t my fault! It
was none of <span class='it'>my</span> doing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not, child. I expect you’re one of
those cut out for queer happenings. There are
such people, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but what do you think about it? How
do you explain it? Do you think, as Nan does,
that kidnappers put her in the car, because
they were frightened for their own safety, if
found with the little thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not altogether likely. I think it’s more
probable the mother abandoned it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how could she! That angel child. She
<span class='it'>is</span> a beauty, isn’t she, Daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very pretty, very pretty, indeed. But a
problem. The end is not yet, Pattykins. I’m
sorry this has happened. There’s been no kidnapping.
If there had it would have been in
the papers. This is, it seems to me, a deep laid
plot of some sort. Well, we must await developments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty went away with Louise to make the
baby a bed for the night, in her own dressing-room.
With pillows and some guarding chairs,
they improvised a crib, and the process of undressing
the baby proved such a gala time that
the whole house rang with merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they took off one little white shoe, a folded
paper dropped out. It was addressed to Patty
herself,—but with a feeling of apprehension as
to what it might contain, she ran downstairs
with it, before she looked inside at all.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap13'></a>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

“It was in the baby’s shoe! I
haven’t read it. Open it, Dad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fairfield took the paper Patty handed
him, and read aloud:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>To Miss Fairfield</span>:—Will you not adopt my little
girl? I am a woman of your own class in society. I
married my father’s chauffeur, and my family disowned
me. Now, I am in most unfortunate circumstances,
but I have tried to keep my baby well-nurtured and
well-dressed. I can do it no longer, and though it
breaks my heart to give her up, I want her to have a
home of refinement and comfort. You are rich, and
you are devoted to charitable work. Will you not keep
her for your own? Or, if you are unwilling to do this,
will you not find a good kind friend who will take her?
Her name is Millicent, but I call her Milly. She is
a year and ten months old, and she has a lovely disposition.
Do not attempt to seek me out. I will never
try to see the child nor will I make trouble in any
way about the adoption. Please keep her yourself.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>From <span class='sc'>Milly’s Mother</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>P. S.—She loves custards and hates oatmeal.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Patty, “here’s a state of things!
Mrs. Milly must think I’m anxious to start an
orphan asylum? The kiddy is a dear,—but
I’m not sure <span class='it'>I</span> care to adopt her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say <span class='it'>not</span>!” and Nan looked indignant.
“I never heard of such nerve!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now,” broke in Mr. Fairfield, “the
poor mother is not so much to be blamed. I
feel very sorry for her. Think of the circumstances.
She married the chauffeur,—ran
away with him, likely,—and now he has doubtless
deserted her, or worse, remained with her
and treats her cruelly. Poor girl, it’s only natural
that she should want her baby to grow up
in a home having the advantages she herself
enjoyed. If I were you, Patty-girl, I’d try to
find a good home for the little waif; that is,
unless you wish to keep her here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Patty, thoughtfully, “I don’t
believe I do. You can’t take a baby as you
would a lapdog. There is a responsibility and
a care that you would have to assume, and I’m
sure I don’t want to devote the better part of
my existence to bringing up a child that doesn’t
belong to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you don’t,” agreed Nan. “The
idea is absurd. But the question is, who would
take her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t think of anybody,” declared Patty,
wrinkling her brows. “Could we advertise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Mr. Fairfield, “that wouldn’t do
at all. You’ll have to keep the baby for a little
while, and ask your friends if they know of a
possible home for her. When it is noised
around, I’m sure some one will come forward to
want her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And meantime, Daddy, you can look after
her! I’m planning a busy winter, and I’ve no
time for stray lambs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you get a nurse?” suggested Mr. Fairfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” and Nan sighed. “But we’ve as
many servants as the house will easily accommodate
now; and a nurse and a nursery and
the nurse’s room will necessitate rearranging
everything. It’s no joke to introduce a baby
member into a household, I can tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can keep my dressing-room for a nursery,”
offered Patty; “I can get along without
it for a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t really big enough,” objected Nan.
“The child must have lots of fresh air, and—oh,
I never <span class='it'>did</span> have any patience with those
idiot people who say, ‘Why do women waste
their affection on dogs? Why not adopt a dear
little baby?’ It’s a very different proposition,
I can tell you! Of course, we’ll have to have a
nurse, if the child stays here at all, but where
we’ll put her <span class='it'>I</span> don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Patty, hopefully, “perhaps we
can find a home for her quickly. And, too, I’d
like to have her here a few weeks. I think
she’s a darling plaything, but I don’t want to
keep her all her life. I wonder who the mother
is. Do you suppose she knows me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she knows of you,” said her
father; “your name is often in the papers in
connection with various charities as well as in
the social notes. She chose you, probably, as
being too kind-hearted to shift the responsibility
of the affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I am! I’ll accept the responsibility of
finding Milly a home, but it can’t be here, of
that I’m certain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How shall you go about it?” asked Nan,
looking helpless and rather hopeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With energy and promptness,” returned
Patty. “And the promptness begins right
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seated herself at the telephone table and
called up a wealthy and childless woman of her
acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mrs. Porter,” she began, “I’ve the
most wonderful opportunity for you! Don’t you
want to adopt a baby girl, a real Wonder-Child,
all big, dark eyes and curly hair and the sweetest
little hands and feet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you, no,” replied the amused
voice at the other end of the line; “it is, indeed,
a chance of a thousand, I am sure; but
we’re going South for the winter, and we
shall be bobbing about, with no settled abode
for a baby. Where did you get the paragon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it on trial, and I want to dispose of it
advantageously. Don’t you know of any one
who might take her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see. I believe Mrs. Bishop did say
something about some friend of hers who knew
of somebody who was about to take a child
from an orphan asylum; but I remember now,
she especially wanted a blonde.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but brunettes are <span class='it'>ever</span> so much nicer!
I’m a blonde myself, and it’s awfully monotonous!
Do tell me the name of the friend’s
friend,—or whoever it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, really. It was about a month
ago I heard of it. But Mrs. Bishop can tell
you,—Mrs. Warrington Bishop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know her,” said Patty, “may I use
your name as an introduction?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. And if I can think up anybody
else I’ll let you know.”</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>That was but the first of a hundred similar
conversations that Patty held. She used the
telephone, as it meant far less time wasted than
personal visits would consume, and she hoped
each call would bring indirect results, if not
immediate success. But everybody was too engrossed
in society or philanthropy or some
hobby or travelling about, to consider for a
moment the acquisition of a new charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two or three times there was a glimmer of
a hope of success and Patty would go flying off
to call on a possible client. But always it
proved a vain chimera. One lady wanted a
baby to adopt, but would only take a boy. Another
was most desirous of an infant, but it
must be not more than six weeks old. Another
had intended adopting a child, but had suddenly
turned to settlement work instead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days went by, and Patty became almost
disheartened. Nan and her father tried to help
her, but they, too, met with no success. Mr.
Fairfield spoke to several business friends
of his, but they either laughed at him or
politely expressed their lack of interest in the
matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A nurse had been engaged, a skilled and capable
trained nurse; for Patty argued that if
they wanted to find a good home for Milly they
must keep her in the pink of condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though the nurse was most efficient, she
was dictatorial and high-tempered, and her superior
air offended the other servants, and
caused Housekeeper Nan no end of trouble.
They thought of changing the nurse, but Miss
Swift took such good care of her charge that
they continued to keep her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small cause of all the excitement went on
her sunny-faced merry-hearted way, unknowing
what turmoil she had stirred up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Middy lub Patty,” she would say, toddling
to Patty’s side as she sat at her everlasting
telephone conversations. “Middy fink Patty
booful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and Patty finks Middy is booful,”
catching the baby up in her arms, “but you are
a terrible responsibility!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fot is tebble spombilty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s what you are. I don’t know what
to do with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lub me,” suggested Milly, twining her
chubby arms around Patty’s neck till she nearly
choked her. “Tell me I’s your pressus baby-kins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you’re all of that; and, as a matter of
fact, I’m getting too fond of you, you little fat
rascal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must beg of you, Miss Fairfield, not to
caress the child so much,” said the cold voice
of Nurse Swift. “It is conceded by all authorities
that kissing is most harmful——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fudge!” said Patty; “I’m only kissing the
back of her neck. Microbes don’t hurt back
there. Do they, Doodlums?” and she cuddled
the baby again, while Miss Swift looked on in
high dudgeon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” she said, primly, “if my advice,
based on experience and knowledge, is
not to be considered at all, it might be well if
you employed some other——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there, Nurse,” interrupted Patty,
“we’re not going to employ anybody else.
Take the kiddy-wid, and put her in a glass case.
Then she won’t get kissed and cuddled by bad,
naughty, ignorant Pattys. By-by, Curly-head!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no! Middy ’tay wiv Patty. Middy not
go wiv bad Nursie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Dearie Girl. Go away with Nursie
now, and get nice bread and milk, and come
back to see Patty some ’nother time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This reasoning worked well and the baby
went off smiling and throwing kisses back to
Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, me, oh, my,” sighed Patty, “what can
I do, what <span class='it'>can</span> I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening Chick Channing called. To him
Patty narrated her difficulties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know of anybody who wants a
perfectly angel child?” she said. “Truly there
never was such a little ray of sunshine, such a
sweet disposition and intelligent mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Channing didn’t know of a single applicant
for such a treasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ll tell you what,” he said; “let’s peddle
her. Tomorrow I’ll come for you in my
runabout, and you have the kiddy all dolled up
fine, and we’ll take her round from house to
house and offer her to the highest bidder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There won’t be any bidders,” said Patty,
disconsolately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. We can exploit her, and
her appearance will be all to the good. Anyway,
we can try it, and it’ll give the poor little
scrap an outing, if nothing more. And give
her overworked nurse a chance for an hour
off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty agreed, and the next afternoon Chick
came for them. The baby looked a dream, in
her white coat and hat, her clustering curls
showing a glimpse of pink hair-ribbon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where first?” asked Chick, as they started
off in gay spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy, <span class='it'>I</span> don’t know!” returned Patty. “I
thought you were running this scheme, and
that you had places in view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I. But if you haven’t either, I suggest
we just stop, hit or miss, at any house that
looks hospitable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, we can’t do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then let’s take her to an orphan asylum
or children’s home and just leave her
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed!” and Patty clasped Milly
close. “She shan’t go to any such place! Why,
they mightn’t be kind to her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably not. But what, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear, I don’t know. What good are
you, Chick, if you can’t suggest something?
I’m worn out pondering on the subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if it’s as bad as that, I <span class='it'>must</span> invent
something. Let me see. Oh, by the way, are
you going to the Meredith tea this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant to go, till you trumped up this plan,
which, if you’ll excuse me, is the biggest wild-goose
chase I ever saw!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless you’re the wild goose. I assure
you I’m not. And to prove it, here’s a plan.
Let’s go to the tea, and take this little exhibit.
There will be hundreds of people there, and
you can auction her off easily enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chick! What a crazy idea! It would never
do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, first, Mrs. Meredith would be highly
indignant at such a performance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not she! You know very well, Patty, she’s
a climber; and she’s most anxious to know you
better, and count you as her friend. Oh, I
know all this inside information, I do! So, if
you do something a bit eccentric, perhaps, but
pretty and effective it will give her tea a certain
prestige, a unique interest that will tickle
her to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty considered. “It might work,” she said,
thinking hard; “but I’ll have to go back and
dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So shall I. But the Belle of the Ball, here,
is all right, isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; or,—no,—I’ll put on her very bestest
frock, all lace and frills. Well, turn back home,
then and come for us again at five. It’s Milly’s
bed-time at six, but no matter, if we provide
her a home and a career.”</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>At five, then, Chick returned, and found a resplendent
pair awaiting him. Patty wore one
of her prettiest afternoon frocks, of Dolly
Varden silk, and Milly was in gossamer linen
and laces, hidden beneath her white cloth coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in effervescent spirits and babbled
continuously in her merry little way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the house, the maid in the cloak-room
stared hard at the baby, but said no word as
she drew off the little coat sleeves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked Milly over, critically, perked up
her enormous pink hair-bow, and shook out her
frills, then they went to the drawing-room,
meeting Chick at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel a mad desire to giggle,” he said, as
he caught sight of Patty, and Milly toddling
beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel a mad desire to run away,” she returned.
“Stand by me, Chick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>A la mort!</span>” he replied, and they entered
the reception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Mrs. Meredith?” said
Patty, in her most dulcet tones. “I took the
liberty of bringing a little friend of mine.
Though she wasn’t invited, I feel sure you can
spare her a little bit of your welcome and hospitality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Meredith, a young woman of great dignity,
looked at Milly in astonishment. As Patty
had carefully taught her, the midget dropped
a dainty courtesy, and smiled up in her hostess’
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remembering the great desirability of Patty’s
friendship, Mrs. Meredith retained her composure,
and laughed. “You dear girl, how
original you are! Who else would have
thought of bringing a baby to my reception?
Is she a relative of yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that,” said Patty, smiling, “but a very
dear friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Channing stepped up to greet
Mrs. Meredith, and others quickly followed,
so that our trio could drift away into the crowd
of chatting, laughing people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we do with Middy?” said Patty,
anxiously. “The little thing will be smothered
down there, among all those full skirts and
floating sashes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For already the tiny mite was entangling her
little fingers in the fringed ends of a lady’s
scarf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take her,” and Chick leaned down, and
picking up Middy, seated her on his broad
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It made a bit of a sensation, for Channing’s
towering height made him always a conspicuous
figure, and the laughing baby attracted
every one’s attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now’s your chance!” he whispered suddenly.
“Everybody is looking at us. Step up
on this chair and auction her off! I <span class='it'>dare</span> you
to!”</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap14'></a>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>A GREAT SUCCESS</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>P</span>atty always declared afterward, that
Chick hypnotised her, and that she <span class='it'>never</span>
would have done it, had she been in her
right mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, on the spur of the moment, carried away
with the spirit of the thing, knowing that it
was then or never, and taunted by the “<span class='it'>dare</span>,”
Patty stepped up on the low chair, and said,
“People Dear” before she realised what she
was about. Then, like a flash, an acute realisation
of what she had done, came over her,
followed with lightning-like swiftness by the
knowledge that she <span class='it'>must</span> go on. To go on
was the only possible justification for having
gone so far. So, go on, she did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear People, listen a minute. This is unconventional
and all that, I know,—but just
hark. Here is a little girl, a beautiful and well-born
child, for somebody’s adoption. Who
wants her? Surely among all of you there is
some woman-heart who could love this dear
baby enough to give her a home. Look at her!
Is she not charming? And as bright and affectionate
as she is pretty. Kiss your hand to
the people, Milly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly always obeyed the slightest wish of her
beloved Patty, and with the most adorable
smiles, and coy glances from her big,
dark eyes, she blew kisses from her tiny fingertips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now love Mr. Chick,” went on Patty, shaking
in her shoes, lest this might try Channing’s
endurance beyond its limit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was game, and when Milly’s dimpled
arms went round his neck and she laid her soft
cheek against his hair, and crooned a few little
love notes, the audience applauded with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” went on Patty, “this baby is
homeless. I want to give her to a kind, wise
and loving woman. No others need apply. I
will say no more now, but any one who is interested
may speak to me about it either here
and now, or at my home. I will tell all particulars
to any one who wants the baby, and will
be the right mother for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flushed with the excitement of the moment,
Patty made a deprecating little bow, and
stepped down from the low chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s silence, and then
Milly’s high, thin little voice piped out: “Me
fink Patty booful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This disarmed criticism and everybody
laughed, while a ripple of applause floated
through the room. And then half a dozen of
the ladies moved toward the end of the room
where Patty and Milly were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were followed by others, for all wanted
to see more closely the interesting mite, and
the unusual circumstance roused curiosity even
among those who had no thought of taking the
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it seemed several did want her, or at least
wanted to investigate the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing, by Patty’s side, helped to answer
questions. He was an invaluable aid, for his
quick wit and pleasant personality made for a
clear understanding of the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, Mrs. Fanning,” he said to a gay
young matron, “you don’t want another olive
branch! You’ve five at home, now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, but this is such a heavenly baby,
and my youngest is eight. I’d love to have this
cherub, though I don’t know what Mr. Fanning
would say——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you musn’t be greedy,” said Chick,
smiling; “be content with your own little brood,
and let somebody take Milly, who really needs
an angel in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly did not become frightened at the
amount of curious attention she received, but
serene and sweet, smiled happily at all, and
cuddled close to Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not difficult to discover who was really
in earnest among the inquirers. Some were
charmed by the baby’s attractions, but had no
thought of taking her to keep. Others looked
at her wistfully, but for one reason or another
were unable to adopt her. But there were
three who were positive of their desire for the
child, and each of the three was determined to
have her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I offered first,” argued Mrs. Chaffee, a
haughty dame, whose dark eyes blazed angrily,
as she noted Patty’s indifference to her claim.
“I wish to have the child, and I can give her
every advantage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So can I,” said Miss Penrose, a delightful
middle-aged spinster, who wanted an heir to
her fortune and a pet to lavish her affection
upon. “I want her very much. I can devote
all my time and attention to her. She shall
have the best of education and training, and
my wealth shall all be hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty considered. Miss Penrose was of aristocratic
family, and her prestige was undeniable.
She would give all care and study to a
most careful, correct bringing up of the baby,
and Milly’s future would be assured. But, and
Patty did not herself realise at first why she
objected to Miss Penrose, until it suddenly
dawned on her that it was because the lady had
no sense of humour! Patty was sure she would
take the upbringing of Milly so seriously that
the sunny baby would become a little automaton.
This was instinctive on Patty’s part, for
she knew Miss Penrose only slightly, but the
earnestness of the lady was very apparent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smilingly holding the question in abeyance,
Patty listened to the plea of the third applicant.
This was Mrs. Colton, a sad-faced, sweet-eyed
young widow. Two years before, a motor accident
had snatched from her her husband and
baby girl, and had left her for a time hovering
between life and death. Only of late, had she
listened to her friends’ urging to go among
people once more, and this tea was almost her
first appearance in society since her tragic
affliction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With tears in her eyes, she said to Patty: “I
<span class='it'>must</span> have the baby. She is not unlike my little
Gladys, and she would be to me a veritable
Godsend. I have thought often of adopting a
child, and this is the one I want. I love her
already. Will you come to me, Milly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly eyed her. For a moment the two looked
at each other intently. There was a breathless
pause, and all who were near felt the dramatic
intensity of the moment. Mrs. Colton smiled,
and it may have been that Milly read in that
smile all the pent-up mother-love and longing,
for she dropped Patty’s hand and walked slowly
toward the lady,—her little arms outstretched.
Reaching her, she threw her arms about her
neck, exclaiming, “I fink you’s booful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This phrase was her highest praise, and as
Mrs. Colton’s arms closed round the child, no
one could doubt that these two hearts were forever
united.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you <span class='it'>will</span> take her, Mrs. Colton,” said
Patty, earnestly; “you are made for each
other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I will take her, if I may. In fact,
I cannot let her go!” and the tear-dimmed
eyes, full of affection, gazed at the little
cherub.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>I</span> want her,” declared Mrs. Chaffee. “I
asked for her first, and I think it most unfair——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not auctioning the baby, Mrs. Chaffee,”
said Patty, smiling at the determined lady; “it
isn’t a question of who asked first. Milly and
Mrs. Colton are too perfectly suited to each
other to let me even consider any other mother
for the child. Please give up all thought of it,
for I have made up my mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Penrose was more acquiescent, and nonchalantly
presumed she could get an equally
pretty baby from an asylum. To which Patty
heartily agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was arranged that Patty should take Milly
home with her for a few days, till Mrs. Colton
could prepare for her reception. Also, she
promised to call in her lawyer and see about
the legal processes of adoption in this most unusual
case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All unwitting of the plans for her destiny,
Milly beamed impartially on everybody, and
went with Patty to make adieux to the hostess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do apologise,” said Patty, smiling, “for
this eccentric performance. But when you
know me better, dear Mrs. Meredith, you will
expect strange happenings when I’m about. All
my friends know this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speech was a clever one, for Mrs. Meredith
greatly desired to be classed among the
friends of Patty Fairfield, the society belle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was charming of you,” she returned, “to
choose my drawing-room for your pretty project.
I trust you will always feel free to avail
yourself of any opportunity I can offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly made her dear little curtsey; Channing
murmured polite phrases, and they went away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” said Chick, as they whirled along
homeward, “we came, we saw, and you bet
we conquered! How about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say we did!” and Patty’s face
glowed with satisfaction and happiness.
“There’s nobody I’d rather give Milly to than
Mrs. Colton. She’s a perfect dear, and her
great sorrow has left her with an aching, hungry
heart, that this little scrap of happiness
can fill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were a brick, Patty! I didn’t think
you’d dare do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t have, if I’d stopped to think. But
you dared me—and I never could refuse a
dare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I claim some of the credit of the success
of our scheme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of it, Chick. I never should have
dreamed of such an unheard of performance!
What <span class='it'>will</span> Nan say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go in and see; may I come in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do. I want you to back me up, if they
jump on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they didn’t. Though Nan and Mr. Fairfield
were utterly astounded at the story they
heard, they had only praise for the result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The very one!” declared Nan. “Mrs. Colton
is a lovely woman, and her wealth and
education and refined tastes will insure Milly
exactly the right kind of a home for life. Oh,
Patty, it’s fine! But what <span class='it'>did</span> Mrs. Meredith
think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Patty, airily, “as it was the illustrious
Me, she was overjoyed to have her house
turned into an auction room! She would have
been equally delighted if I’d made a bear garden
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You conceited little rascal,” said her father,
shocked at this self-esteem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it wasn’t <span class='it'>my</span> idea. You all know <span class='it'>my</span>
overweening modesty. But Chick, here, said
that the parvenu element in the lady’s soul
would be kindly disposed toward,—well, let us
say, toward the daughter of Frederick Fairfield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This turning of the tables made them all
laugh, but Channing said, “It’s quite true. I
know the Meredith type, and I was sure that
to be made conspicuous by an acknowledged
social power, like our Patty, would be unction
to her soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it was a crazy piece of business,” said
Mr. Fairfield, “but as it turned out so admirably,
we can’t complain. It is right down
splendid, to get the little one taken by such a
fine woman as Mrs. Colton. I’m sure it will
be a most successful arrangement. And we
owe you a vote of thanks, Channing, for bringing
it about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m only accessory before the fact.
Patty did it. I wish you could have seen her
when she mounted that chair! It was as good
as a play. Her do-or-die expression, concealed
beneath a society smile, was a whole show!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care, I accomplished my purpose,”
and Patty beamed with satisfaction; “but it
was mostly because Chick dared me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us hope I’ll always be present at any
crisis in your life to dare you!” said Channing.
“It’s an easy way to achieve great results.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Patty’s friends heard of her episode,
they bombarded her with telephone messages
and notes and calls concerning it. Some chaffed
her and others praised, but all were agog over
the matter. Even Mrs. Van Reypen telephoned
to know if the report she had heard
were true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you hear?” asked Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you went to a tea and auctioned off a
baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that isn’t quite the true version of what
happened. Now, I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t. I can’t bear to talk over the
telephone. Come and see me, and bring that
child along. I want to see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Van Reypen’s wish was usually looked
upon as a command, and the next afternoon
Patty started off with Milly to call on her
elderly friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a baby! Oh, <span class='it'>what</span> a baby!” was the
greeting the child received, for Mrs. Van Reypen
was most enthusiastic. “Why didn’t you
keep her yourself? How can you let her go?
I never saw such a lovely baby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is,” agreed Patty, smiling, as Milly curtsied
to Mrs. Van Reypen over and over again.
“But I couldn’t keep her. I don’t want the
care and responsibility of a kiddy. Would you
have liked to take her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I would, if you had offered me the
chance. But no, I am too old to train a
baby now. Do you know, though, Patty, the
care of orphan children has always appealed
to me as one of the best of philanthropies. I
sometimes think even yet I will start a home
for such little waifs. I mean a real homelike
sort of a place,—not the institution usually
founded for such a purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a splendid thing, Lady Van. Go
ahead, and do it. I will help you, if I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you, Patty? Would you give of your
time and interest to help establish the thing,
and be one of the workers for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I would. I don’t want the entire responsibility
of little Milly, but I am glad I’ve
found a good home for her. And if there are
other similar little unfortunates, and of course
there are, I’d be more than willing to help you
in a project to make them happy and cared
for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll remember that, and I think I’ll set
about planning for it. I’m getting older all the
time, and what I do, ought to be begun soon.
Patty, you are very dear to me,—you know
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s kind of you to say so, Lady Van, and
I do appreciate and greatly value your affection
for me. I wish I could do something to show
my love in return, and if you decide to go into
this scheme of yours, call on me for any help
I can give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, dear. But, Patty, there is another
way in which you could greatly please me,—if
you—but I think you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty did know what was coming, but she affected
ignorance. “’Most any way, Lady
Van, I’m glad to please you, but I think this
Orfling Home plan the most feasible and practicable.
When shall us begin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m not thinking of that just now. Patty,
you dear girl,—don’t you—<span class='it'>can’t</span> you bring
yourself to care for Philip?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I do care for Phil. I care for him a
lot. We’re the greatest chums. He’ll help us
with the new scheme, won’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I mean to care for him, especially. The
way he cares for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, dear Lady Van, let’s not discuss that
today. I’m so busy getting this matter of Milly
fixed up, I can’t turn to other topics. Don’t
you think it would be nice for me to get a sort
of wardrobe together for her, before she goes
to Mrs. Colton’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I think it would be ridiculous! Mrs.
Colton has plenty of means, and she has taste
and knows what is right and proper for the
child far better than you do. Give the baby a
parting gift if you like—I’ll give her one myself.
I’ll give her a silver porringer. She’s
’most too big for a porringer, but she can keep
it for an heirloom. The one I mean to give
her is an old Dutch one of real value. But,
Patty, as to Philip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now, please, Lady Van, dear,” and
Patty put her fingers to her ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, some other time, then. But, Patty, if
you could learn to care for my boy, I’d—I’d
make you my heir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, fie, fie, Lady Van! You’re trying to buy
my young affections? Now, you mustn’t do that.
And, too, don’t you know that the best way to
make me dislike Phil is to continually urge him
upon me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Van Reypen looked a little taken aback
at this, and immediately dropped the subject,
for which Patty was devoutly thankful. She
did like Philip, but she did not want his aunt
arranging affairs for her, for Patty was an independent
nature, and especially so where her
plans for her own future were concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she gladly turned the conversation back
to the matter of the Children’s Home, and
soon realised that Mrs. Van Reypen was
greatly in earnest about it, and that it might
soon become a reality.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap15'></a>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>PATTY’S FUTURE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>O</span>ne day Patty was at a matinée with
some of the girls, when Mrs. Van
Reypen called at the Fairfield home. It
being Saturday afternoon, Mr. Fairfield was
at home, and the visitor asked to see him as
well as his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After greetings were exchanged, the straight-forward
old lady went at once to her subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come to see you about Patty,” she began,
“and if you choose to tell me I’m a meddlesome
old woman and concerning myself with
what is none of my business, you will be quite
within your rights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt we shall do that, Mrs. Van Reypen,”
said Fred Fairfield, pleasantly. “What is it
about Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only this. To put it in plain words, I want
her to marry my nephew Philip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should make no objections to that. Indeed,
I should be glad and proud to have my
daughter become the wife of your nephew. He
is a fine man. I feel that I know him well and
there is no one to whom I would rather entrust
Patty’s happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Fairfield. Phil <span class='it'>is</span> a good
boy, and I have yet to learn a mean or ignoble
thing about him. What is your opinion, Mrs.
Fairfield?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite agree with my husband,” returned
Nan. “Philip has always been one of my
favourites among Patty’s friends, and I, too,
should hear of their engagement with pleasure.
But, Mrs. Van Reypen, we cannot answer for
Patty herself. She is, as you perhaps know, a
self-willed young person, and not to be driven
or even advised, against her will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s just it. Patty doesn’t know her
own will. She takes for granted all the attentions
and favours of the young men, and, goodness
knows she gets enough of them, but it
never seems to occur to her that it’s time she
thought about making a choice of one in particular.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come, now, Mrs. Van Reypen, Patty
is not yet climbing up on the traditional shelf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that, Mr. Fairfield, but the point is,
that she is heart-whole and fancy-free, and
while she is, I desire to influence her mind toward
Philip. Yes, just that. It is not wrong;
on the contrary, it is a wise thing to do. In
France the girls’ betrothals are always arranged
by their elders. In England they frequently
are. And there is no reason the plan shouldn’t
obtain in our country. We all have Patty’s
best interests at heart, and if we can help this
thing along,—without letting the child know it,
of course,—it is our duty as well as our pleasure
to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how, Mrs. Van Reypen?” asked Nan.
“Patty would quickly resent any interference
or dictation in her affairs; and, too, any hint
that we were helping Philip’s cause along,
would, I assure you, react disastrously to our
effort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, certainly, if she <span class='it'>knew</span> it,” and Mrs. Van
Reypen spoke impatiently; “but she needn’t
know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, then, shall it be done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In lots of ways. Let us throw them together
whenever possible. See to it that she accepts
his invitations here and there. Place
them next each other at dinners; in a word,
make it clear to the other members of their
circle, that they are definitely <span class='it'>for</span> each other,
and it will shortly be recognized and accepted
as a fact. I will give opera parties and dinner
parties, and I will see to it, that they are conspicuously
paired as partners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds plausible, Mrs. Van Reypen,”
and Nan shook her head; “but it is not so easy.
You, of course, see them together often, but
Patty goes to many parties where Philip is not
invited, or if he <span class='it'>is</span> there, where she is escorted
by some one else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just it!” and the old lady’s tone was
vibrant with enthusiasm; “we must see to it
that she is invited everywhere first by Philip,
and then she can’t accept these other invitations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan smiled at the thought of thus ordering
headstrong Patty’s engagement calendar, but
she only said, “I’m sure if you can accomplish
this, I shall be but too glad. For I, too, want
to see Patty happily married. I am in no haste
for the event to occur, but I would like to rest
assured that her choice will be a wise one, and
one that will mean her lifelong happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that would be insured by her betrothal
to Philip,” and Philip’s aunt looked complacent.
“And I am sure the dear girl would be
willing to say yes to him, if she were convinced
that it was time for her to make a choice. Will
you not, both of you, do all you can to bring
this about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure,” said Mr. Fairfield, “but, as
my wife says, it is not easy to force or coerce
my daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not force or coerce! Have you people
no idea of diplomacy? Of strategy, even,
if necessary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just how may diplomacy be directly employed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Principally, perhaps, by inducing propinquity.
The more they are together, the more
they will care for one another. Though to be
sure, Philip is deeply in love with Patty, now.
He has, I am sure, asked her to marry him already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if he has, and she has refused him,”
said Nan, “what more can we do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Refused him? Nothing of the sort! She
hasn’t accepted him, of course, or we would
know of it; but you know how girls, nowadays,
play fast and loose with a man, if they are sure
of his devotion. Indeed, if Philip could be persuaded
to slight Patty a little, now and then, it
would soon pique her into an acceptance. But
he will never do that,—I know him too well.
Philip is a dear boy, but a straightforward nature,
with no thought of trifling or deception.
No, we must devote our efforts toward Patty’s
attitude, not Philip’s. He is all right as he is.
If Patty will consent to marry my nephew, I am
considering making her my heiress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Van Reypen!” Fred Fairfield exclaimed
in indignation, “I beg you will not use
any such argument or bribe in connection with
my daughter’s name!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hoity-toity, now! Don’t get excited. ’Tis
no bribe. ’Tis but the fact; if so be that Patty
will become my niece, I shall divide my wealth
equally between her and my nephew. She shall
have half in her own right. If she will not,
half is still Philip’s and the other half will go
to a charity. I don’t want to give it all to
Philip. He is already a rich man, and I don’t
approve of too big fortunes for young men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind about the money part of it,”
said Nan. “I am quite willing to espouse Mrs.
Van Reypen’s cause, irrespective of her will.
And, too, if Patty does marry Philip, it is quite
right and proper that she should inherit this
wealth. If not, there is no question of her having
it. So the fortune element settles itself.
But what I can’t see is how we’re going about
this thing. I’m somewhat practical, Mrs. Van
Reypen, and I confess I can see no practical
way to bring these two hearts to beat as one.
If you can instruct me, I shall be glad to obey
orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan looked very pretty and sweet as she spoke
in earnest on the subject. She meant just what
she said. She would be very glad to have Patty
marry Philip, very glad to do anything she
could to help bring it about, but for the life
of her she couldn’t see anything to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Mrs. Van Reypen defended her
stand, “when I took them on that motor trip
together with me, that was a step in the right
direction. They were thrown so much in one
another’s company, that it became inevitable
to them to be together. I always thought if
that Mr. Farnsworth hadn’t joined us up at
Lake Sunapee, the matter would have been settled
then and there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think Mr. Farnsworth interfered?”
asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure. Do you think Patty cares for
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I think not,” said Fred Fairfield.
“They seem to have little tiffs when they’re
together, and I doubt they are very congenial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to like Bill Farnsworth,” said Nan,
“but since I learned that he tried to bring about
Patty’s going on the stage, I’ve not cared so
much for him. You see, he’s a Westerner, and
he has different ideas from ours. Imagine
Patty on the stage! And it was unpardonable
in him to put the idea in her head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Philip said he heard that Mr. Farnsworth
took Patty over to the hotel where that
actress was staying, to talk the matter over.
And he says that Patty herself said that Bill
said she was good-looking enough to go on the
stage! Fancy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an outrage! That whole stage business
makes my blood boil!” and Mrs. Van Reypen’s
very bonnet strings shook in righteous
indignation. “That’s what you get for letting
her associate with a man like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come now,” said Mr. Fairfield,
“Farnsworth is a good sort. I think he’s very
much of a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fine type of a man to try to get a nice
girl like Patty to become a common actress!”
The aristocratic visitor’s face expressed the
deepest scorn of the theatrical profession as a
whole. “But she’s all over that, isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, thank goodness!” answered Nan.
“Well, all I can see to do, is, to incline Patty
toward Philip in any subtle way we can. Praise
him to her, judiciously, not too much. Compare
him favourably with other men, especially Mr.
Farnsworth, for I’m not sure that Patty doesn’t
like him quite a little. Then let Philip come
here often and we will make him very welcome,
and the rest I think he will have to accomplish
himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have expressed it very well, Mrs. Fairfield,”
and the visitor rose to go. “And I’m
sure other ways and means will suggest themselves
to you as time goes on. If you would
sometimes ask him to dinner quite <span class='it'>en famille</span>,
I will do the same by Patty. Such things,—letting
them be alone together of an evening now
and then,—will do wonders.”</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'>And so the plans were made, and the schemers,
who were all actuated by an honest desire
for Patty’s happiness, began to watch for opportunities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mrs. Van Reypen had surmised, in her
wise, canny mind, there were ways, unobtrusive
and delicate, by which the two young people
could be thrown together more frequently and
none of these was neglected. Nothing insistent
or noticeable was ever attempted, but after a
time, Patty found herself relying on Philip’s
advice and judgment, and unconsciously referring
questions to him for settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Van Reypen and the elder Fairfields
noted this approvingly, and the whole circle of
young people came gradually to look on Philip
as Patty’s special property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Van Reypen was by no means averse to this,
and he adopted an attitude of ownership, which,
as it became definite, was quickly resented by
Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Phil,” she said one day; “you
needn’t act as if I belonged to you. Don’t decide
things for me without my consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, Patty. I’ve no wish to offend.
But you will belong to me some day, and I suppose
I’m too impatient for the day to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know I will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s written in the stars. We were made for
each other. You’ll wake up to the fact some
day, perhaps soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ha’e me doots,” said Patty, in roguish
mood, and her light laughter checked the more
serious words that rose to Philip’s lips. He
was content to bide his time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day he telephoned to Patty that Mrs. Van
Reypen was not well and begged she would
come over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she ill?” asked Patty in surprise, for the
hale old lady was a valetudinarian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite that, but she has a cold, and she
wants cheering up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Patty ordered the car and went right over.
She found that Mrs. Van Reypen did, indeed,
have a cold, and a severe one. Patty was
alarmed and insisted on calling the doctor, who
pronounced it a case of grip, and ordered the
patient to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty remained over night, for Mrs. Van Reypen
was feverish and too nervous and worried
about herself to be left to the care of servants.
Late in the evening, however, she became
quieter, and begged Patty to leave her to herself
for a time, and go downstairs and sit with
Philip and cheer up the poor boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, having made the sick lady as comfortable
as she could, Patty ran downstairs for a
while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was garbed in a boudoir robe of Mrs.
Van Reypen’s. She had discarded her street
gown as being out of place in the sick room,
and had rummaged in her hostess’ wardrobe
until she selected one of the many house gowns
and negligées that hung there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was utterly inappropriate for the girl, being
made of purple silk, with a wide berthé of
Duchess lace. But it made Patty look very
quaint and sweet,—like a maid of olden time.
She had twisted her curls up high, and added
a large carved ivory comb, from the dressing
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Puritan Maiden, Priscilla,” she had
said, laughingly as she pirouetted before her
hostess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very fetching garb,” remarked the old
lady. “You may have it to keep. You can use
it in your amateur theatricals, or such dressings
up, and the berthé is of valuable old
lace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty thanked her kind friend, but to tell the
truth, she was so accustomed to receiving gifts
from Mrs. Van Reypen that one more was but
as a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, on being dismissed from the sick room,
Patty ran lightly downstairs, and into the
library. Only a shaded table light was turned
on, and in the glow of the firelight Philip sat,
in an easy chair, smoking. When he heard
Patty enter, he threw his cigar in the fire, and
holding out his arm, he drew her down to the
broad tufted arm of the great chair he sat in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How goes it upstairs?” he asked, casually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not very well,” said Patty, soberly. “I don’t
want to be a ‘calamity howler,’ but I think Lady
Van is more ill than she knows. This grip is
a treacherous thing, and liable to take sudden
turns for the worse. And, too, she is not as
young as she once was, and so, Philip, I want
you to take all precautions. I will look after
her tonight, but tomorrow you must get a
nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will. Send for one now, if you
say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can manage for tonight. She is resting
quietly now. She is bright and cheery, you
understand, but she is weak, and the disease has
a strong hold on her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, what a dear girl you are!” Philip
spoke in a fine, honest, manly way, and Patty
thrilled at his so sincere praise. “You are one
in a thousand! Indeed, I’m sure there never
was another like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ’way wid yer blarney,” laughed Patty,
a least bit embarrassed because she knew it was
not mere blarney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the truth, dear, and you know it. Oh,
Patty, wouldn’t it be nice if you lived here all
the time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I could take care of Lady Van?” and
her light laugh rang out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and so you could take care of me. I
need taking care of,—that is, I need you to take
care of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Philip, you’re the most capable person
I know. You can take care of yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, I wish you lived here so I could
take care of you. Would you like that, you
little Colonial Dame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m pretty independent. I’m not sure I’d
take kindly to being taken care of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would like the way <span class='it'>I’d</span> take care of you,
I promise you that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, how would it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty knew she was playing with fire. She
knew that unless she meant to encourage Philip
Van Reypen, she ought not to lead him on in
this way. But Patty was very feminine, and the
temptation to know just what he meant was
very strong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Philip laid his warm hand gently on
hers, “in the first place, you should never
know a care or a trouble that I could bear for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said Patty, “that’s comforting, but
not so very entertaining.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You little witch! Do you want entertainment?
Well, then, I’d make it my life work
to invent new entertainments for you every day.
How’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s better,” and naughty Patty showed
animated delight at the prospect. “What
would the entertainments be like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s telling. They’d be surprises, and I
can’t divulge their secrets till you do come to
live here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did live here once,” said Patty, smiling at
the recollection. “As Lady Van’s companion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now won’t you come and live here as
my companion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, are you getting old enough to need a
companion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sure am! I’m twenty-six, and that’s the
very exact age when a man wants a companion,
or, at any rate, this man does. Will you, Patty
Precious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno. Tell me more about these entertainments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they should comprise all the best ones
that are to be found on the face of the earth.
And when you tired of them, I would make up
new ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parties?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, parties of every sort. Dances, theatre
parties, motor parties, dinner parties,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And little twosy parties,—just you and me
all alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty! you witch! do you want to drive me
crazy? Now, just for that, you’ve got to say
yes, and live here with me, and have all the
little twosy parties you want!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Philip, <span class='it'>I</span> proposed them, you didn’t!”
and Patty pouted until her scarlet lips looked
like a cleft cherry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I didn’t dare. Do you suppose I
let myself think that you would care for such?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know as I do. I’ve never tried
them!” And Patty ran out of the room.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap16'></a>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE PROMISE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>O</span>n returning to Mrs. Van Reypen’s
room, Patty found that lady sleeping
quietly, so she herself went to bed on
a couch in the dressing-room adjoining. Next
morning, the patient was weak and ill, and
when the doctor arrived he sent at once for two
nurses. Patty went home, feeling sad, for she
feared her kind old friend might not survive
this illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nan cheered her up, saying that while
grip was sometimes a serious matter, more
often, it was light and of short duration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is contagious,” Nan went on, “and I
don’t want you to catch it, Patty. Don’t go
over there again, until Mrs. Van Reypen gets
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty agreed to this, but a few days later,
there came such an imperative summons from
Mrs. Van Reypen that Patty felt she must respond
to the call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t go very near her,” begged Nan,
as Patty started. “You are susceptible to colds,
and if you get grip, it will wear you out.”</p>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching the house, Patty was shocked at the
appearance of Mrs. Van Reypen. She was
emaciated and her face had a waxen pallor.
But her dark eyes were feverishly bright, and
she greeted Patty with an eager smile. Then
she sent the nurse from the room, with peremptory
orders not to return until called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, I want to talk to you,” the old lady
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Lady Van,” said Patty, lightly,
“but you musn’t talk much. If it’s an important
subject, you’d better wait till you are
stronger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never be stronger, my dear. This is
my last illness,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, now, don’t talk like that. Grip always
makes its patients discouraged, but you are too
sensible to be fooled by it. Brace up, and resolve
to get well, and then you will get well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was arguing against her own convictions,
for she saw the ravages the disease had made,
and she feared the worst. But she did all she
could to cheer and encourage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s useless for you to talk like that,” the invalid
went on, “for I know what I know. Now
listen to me. I am going to die. I know it,
and I am not afraid. I am seventy years old,
I <a id='have'></a>have had a happy life, and if my time
has come, I am willing to die. Life is sweet,
but we must all die, and it is only a coward
who fears death. I am going to leave you a
fortune, Patty. I have made my will and in
it, I bequeath you a hundred thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lady Van,” Patty gasped, “don’t,
<span class='it'>don’t</span> leave me all that money! I should be overcome
with the responsibility of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! But listen to the plan. I want
you to have half of it absolutely for yourself,
and the other half, use to build a Children’s
Home. I know you will enjoy doing this, and
I trust you to do it well. Thus, you see, your
own share of the money is, in a way, payment
for your work and responsibility of the Home.
You may build, rent, or buy a house for the
purpose. Your father and Philip will help you
as to the business matters. But the furnishing
and house planning will be your work. Will
you do this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love to do it!” and Patty’s eyes shone
at the idea. “If I am capable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you’re capable. Not a big Home,
you understand, but as large as the money will
properly pay for. Then, have it bright and
pretty, and if it only accommodates a dozen
children, I don’t care. I know this is your favourite
form of philanthropy and it is also
mine. I wish we could have done it together,
but it is too late for that now. But Philip will
help you, and if more money is necessary, he
will give it to you, from his own inheritance.
Phil is a rich man, but I shall leave him all my
fortune except what I give you. So don’t hesitate
to ask him if you need more funds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, but I shall put your whole bequest
into the scheme. I don’t want to be paid for
doing what will be a great pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a little simpleton! You will take
your own half for your individual use, and not
a cent of it is to go toward the Home. There
is money enough for that. And it isn’t payment.
I give it to you, because I am really
very fond of you. You have made sunshine
in my life ever since I first found you, and I
am glad to give you a small fortune. When
you marry, as you will some day, you will find
it very nice to be able to buy what you want
for your trousseau. You can buy worth-while
jewels with it, or, if you prefer, put it out at
interest and have a stated income. But accept
it you must, or I shall think you don’t love me
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I do. Dear Lady Van, you know
I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then don’t upset my last hours by refusing
what I offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty almost laughed at the snappish tone, so
incongruous in one who was making a splendid
gift. But Mrs. Van Reypen was getting more
and more excited. A red spot burned in either
cheek, and her eyes blazed as she gesticulated
from her pillows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s another thing, Patty Fairfield,
that you are to do for me. You are to marry
my boy, Philip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” and Patty laughed lightly, “we won’t
discuss that now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we will discuss it now. I want your
promise. Do you suppose I got you over here
just to tell you about my will? No. I want
you to promise me that you will grant me this
happiness before I die. Philip loves you deeply.
He wants you for his wife and he has told you
so. Where could you find a better man? A
more honourable, a kinder, a more generous
and loving heart? And he worships you. He
would always be gentle and tender with
you. He is of fine old stock, there is no better
family tree in the country than the Van Reypens.
Now, will you give me your promise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lady Van, I can’t promise offhand, like
this. You must let me think it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve had time enough for that. Tell me,—you
care for Philip, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed I care for him a great deal,—as
a friend. But I don’t think I love him as I
ought to—as I want to love the man I marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlesticks! You don’t know your own
mind, that’s all. You’re a foolish, sentimental
child. Now, look here, you marry Philip soon,—and
you’ll find out that you do love him.
Why, who could help it? He’s such a splendid
fellow. He would make you as happy as the
day is long. Patty, he’s a man of a thousand.
He hasn’t a bad trait or an unworthy thought
in his mind. You don’t know how really fine
he is. And he adores you so,—he would give
you every wish of your heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know he would. He has told me so. But
I can’t feel sure that I care for him in the right
way. And I can’t promise——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean you won’t! You are willing to
trifle with Philip’s affections and lead him on
and lure him with false hopes and then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, stop! That’s not fair! I never led
him on! We have been good friends for years,
but I never even imagined his wanting to marry
me until he told me so last summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last summer! And you haven’t given him
a definite answer yet! You keep him on tenter-hooks
without the least consideration or care
as to his feelings. If he were not such a patient
man, he would have given up all idea of
wanting you. Do you know what you are,
Patty Fairfield? You’re a little flirt, that’s
what you are! You ought to be ashamed of
yourself! How many other men have you on
a string? Several, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Van, you have no right to talk to me
like this? If you were not ill, I’d be very angry
with you. But as you are, I ascribe your harsh
speeches to the illness that is racking you. Now,
let us drop the subject and talk of something
pleasanter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll do nothing of the sort! I sent for
you to get your promise, and I’m going to get
it!” Mrs. Van Reypen sat upright in her bed,
and shook her clenched hand at Patty. “You
little fool!” she cried, “any girl in her senses
would be only too glad to get such a man as my
nephew! You are honoured by his wanting
you. I am very fond of you myself,—you are
so pretty and sunny-faced. But if you refuse
me this wish of my heart, I shall cease to love
you. I won’t leave you that money, I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady’s voice rose nearly to a shriek,
and she glared at Patty with a fairly malevolent
gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That last speech was too much for Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want your money,” she said, rising
to go. “I cannot stay and listen to such unjust
remarks as you have been making. I’m sorry,
but I can’t give you the promise you ask, and
as I can’t please you I think I’d better go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” begged Mrs. Van Reypen, and
now her anger was gone, and her tones were
wheedlesome. “Forgive me, dear, I have no
right to force your will. But please, Patty
Girl, think it over, here and now. You can
easily learn to love Phil,—you’re not in love
with anybody else, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, as I say, you can easily learn to love
him, he is such a dear. And he would treat
you like a princess. He would shower you with
gifts and pleasures. You could live in this
house, or he would buy you or build you whatever
home you fancied. Then, together, you
could carry out my project for the Children’s
Home. Your life would be a heaven on earth.
Don’t you think so, Patty,—dear Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Lady Van chose she could be very sweet
and ingratiating. And she seemed to hypnotize
Patty. The girl looked at her with a hesitating
expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say yes,” pleaded the old lady. “Please,
Patty, say yes. You’ll never regret it, and you
will be happy all your life. And you will have
the satisfaction of knowing that you eased the
last hours of a dying woman and sent her out
of the world happy and contented to go. For I
am dying, Patty. You do not know all of my ills.
I may live a few days, but not longer. The doctor
knows and so do the nurses. I haven’t told
Philip, for I hate to cause him pain. But if I
can tell him of your promise to marry him, it
will mitigate his grief at saying farewell to me.
Now you will say yes, won’t you, my dear little
Patty Girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No buts now. You couldn’t have the heart
to refuse the dying request of one who has always
loved you like a daughter. I would gladly
have adopted you, Patty, had your people been
willing to spare you. I went to see your parents
not long ago. Your father said there is no
man in the world he would rather see you marry
than Philip. And Mrs. Nan said the same.
Why do you fight against it so? Is it merely
shyness? Just maidenly reserve? If that’s it,
I understand and appreciate. But waive all
that, for my time is short. You needn’t marry
him at once if you don’t wish, but promise me
that he shall be your choice. That he will be
the man you will some day wed and make
happy. Won’t you promise, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—can’t——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you can!” Mrs. Van Reypen leaned
out of her bed, and grasped Patty’s arm in a
vise-like clutch. “You can and you shall!
Now,—at once! Promise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black eyes of the old lady bored into
Patty’s own. Her firm, hard mouth was set
in a straight line. And with both hands she
gripped Patty’s arms and shook her slightly.
“Promise, or I shall die on the spot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise,” said Patty, faintly, urged on by
the older woman’s force of intensity of will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Van Reypen fell back exhausted. She
seemed unconscious, but whether in a faint, or
stunned by sudden reaction, Patty did not
know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flew to the door and called the nurse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness! What happened?” inquired
Miss French. “Has she had any sort of mental
shock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has given me one,” returned Patty, but
the nurse was busy administering restoratives,
and paid no heed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty went slowly downstairs and out into the
street. She walked home in a daze. What had
she done? For to Patty a promise was a sacred
thing and not to be broken. She hoped Mrs.
Van Reypen would get better and she would
go and ask to be released from a promise
that was fairly wrung from her. She was undecided
whether to tell Nan about it or not,
but concluded to wait a day or two first. And
then, she thought to herself, why wasn’t she
prepared to fulfill the promise? Why didn’t
she want to marry Phil, big, kind-hearted Phil,
who loved her so deeply? At times it almost
seemed as if she did want to marry him, and
then again, she wasn’t sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll sleep over it,” she thought, “and by tomorrow
I’ll know my own mind better. I must
be a very wobbly-brained thing, anyhow. Why
don’t I know what I want? But I suppose
every girl feels like this when she tries to make
up her mind. Philip is a dear, that’s certain.
Maybe I’m worrying too much over it. Well,
I’ll see by tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the next day and the next, Patty was
equally uncertain as to whether she was glad
or sorry that she had made that promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after another day or two she went down
herself with the grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you you’d catch it from Mrs. Van
Reypen,” scolded Nan. “You had no business
to go there and expose yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I had to go when she sent for me,” said
Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did she want of you? you never told
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for one thing, she thinks she’s going
to die, and she wants to leave me a hundred
thousand dollars in her will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hundred thousand! Patty, you must be
crazy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it isn’t all for me, only half.” And
then Patty told about the plan for the Children’s
Home, but she said nothing about the
promise she had given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan was greatly excited over the bequest.
“But,” she said, “I don’t believe Mrs. Van
is going to die. She’s better today. I just
telephoned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope she won’t die,” said Patty fervently.
“I don’t want her money, and if she gets well
she can run that Home project herself, and I’ll
willingly help. Oh, Nan, I do feel horrid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grip has the reputation of making people feel
horrid. The doctor came and sent Patty to
bed, and for several days she had a high fever,
which was aggravated by her mental worry
over the promise she had made to Mrs. Van
Reypen.</p>

<div><h1><a id='chap17'></a>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE CRISIS</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span>nd then the day came when the doctor
said Patty had pneumonia. Rooms were
darkened; nurses went around silently;
Nan wandered about, unable to concentrate her
mind on anything and Mr. Fairfield spent much
of his time at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The telephone was continually ringing, as one
friend after another asked how Patty was, and
the rooms downstairs were filled with the gifts
of flowers that the patient might not even see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What word, Doctor?” asked Mona Galbraith,
as the physician came downstairs, one
morning. The girls came and went as they
chose. Always some one or more of them were
sitting in the library or living-room, anxiously
awaiting news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I can say she’s holding her own,” replied
the doctor, guardedly; “if she had a
stronger constitution, I should feel decidedly
hopeful. But she is a frail little body, and we
must be very, very careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hurried away, and Mona turned back to
where Elise sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know she’ll die,” wailed Elise. “I just
<span class='it'>know</span> Patty will die. Oh, it seems <span class='it'>such</span> a
shame! I can’t <span class='it'>bear</span> it!” and she broke down
in a tumult of sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, Elise,” begged Mona. “Why not
hope for the best? Patty isn’t strong,—but
she’s a healthy little piece, and that doctor is a
calamity howler, anyway. Everybody says so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, but somehow I have a presentiment
Patty never will get well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presentiments are silly things! They don’t
mean a thing! I’d rather have hope than all
the presentiments in the world. Here comes
Roger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowing his sister and his fiancée were there,
Roger came in. They told him what the doctor
had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brace up, girls,” he said, cheeringly. “The
game’s never out till it’s played out. I believe
our spunky little Patty will outwit the old pneumonia
and get the better of it. She always
comes out top of the heap somehow. And
her holding on so long is a good sign. Don’t
you want to go home now, Mona? You look
all tired out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do go, Mona,” said Elise, kindly. “But
it isn’t tiredness, Roger, it’s anxiety. Go on,
you two, I’ll stay a while longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pair went, and Elise sat alone in the
library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, through the stilled house, she heard
Patty’s voice ring out, high and shrill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t <span class='it'>want</span> it!” Patty cried; “I don’t <span class='it'>want</span>
the fortune! And I don’t want to marry <span class='it'>anybody</span>!
Why do they make me <span class='it'>promise</span> to marry
everybody in the whole world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice was that of delirium. Though not
really delirious, Patty’s mind was flighty, and
the sentences that followed were disjointed and
incoherent. But they all referred to a fortune
or to a marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can she mean?” sobbed Nan, who,
with her husband, sat in an adjoining room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, dear, it’s her feverish, disordered
imagination talking. If she were herself,
she wouldn’t know what those words
meant. Perhaps it is better that her mind wanders.
Some say that’s a good sign. Keep up
hope, Nan, darling, if only for my sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Fred. And we have cause for hope.
Doctor is by no means discouraged, and if we
can tide over another twenty-four hours——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—if we can——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will! Something tells me Patty will get
well. The clear look in her eyes this morning——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were they clear, Nan? Did they seem so
to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear, they did. And the nurse said that
meant a lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the specialist doctor—he said Patty is
so frail——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she is, and always has been. But that’s
in her favour. It’s often the strong, robust people
that go off quickest with pneumonia. Patty
has a wiry, nervous strength that is a help to
her now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re such a comfort, Nan. But I don’t
want Patty to die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I, Fred. She is nearly as dear to me
as to you. You know that, I’m sure. And
Patty is a born fighter. She’s like you in that.
I know she’ll battle with that disease and conquer
it,—I <span class='it'>know</span> she will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please God you’re right, dearest. Let us
hope it with all our hearts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alone, Patty fought her life and death battle.
Doctors, nurses, friends, all did what they
could, but alone she grappled with the angel of
death. All unconsciously, too, but with an involuntary
struggle for life against the grim foe
that held her. Now and again her voice cried
out in delirium or murmured in a babbling
monotone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now racked with fever, now shivering with a
chill, the tortured little body shook convulsively
or lay in a death-like stupor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once, when Kit Cameron was downstairs,
they heard Patty shriek out about the fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Kit, awestruck; “can she mean
that fortune-telling business we had? Don’t
you remember I told her she’d inherit a fortune.
Of course, I was only joking. Fortune-tellers
always predict a legacy. I hope <span class='it'>that</span>
hasn’t worried her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Nan, shaking her head, “it isn’t
that. She’s been worrying about that fortune
ever since she’s been flighty. I know what she
means. Never mind it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glad that it was not an unfortunate result of
his practical joke, Kit dropped the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want her to get well so terribly,” he went
on. “I just <span class='it'>can’t</span> have it otherwise. I’ve always
cherished a sort of forlorn hope that I
could win her yet. Do you think I’ve a chance,
Mrs. Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we get her well again, we’ll see,” and
Nan tried to speak cheerfully. “But it’s awfully
nice of you boys to come round so often.
You cheer us up a good deal. Mr. Fairfield is
not very hopeful. You see Patty’s mother died
so young, and Patty is very like her, delicate,
fragile, though almost never really ill. And
here comes another of my boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan always called Patty’s friends her boys;
and they all liked the pleasant, lively young
matron, and affectionately called her Mrs. Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time it was Chick Channing, and he came
to inquire after Patty, and also to bring the
sad news that Mrs. Van Reypen was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though not entirely unexpected, for the old
lady had been very ill, it was a shock, and cast
a deeper gloom over the household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry for Philip,” said Nan. “He
was devoted to his aunt, and she idolised him.
Of late, he practically made his home with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose he is her heir,” observed Channing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so,” returned Nan, listlessly. And
then she suddenly remembered what Patty had
said about Mrs. Van’s bequest to her. But she
decided to make no mention of it at present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a wealthy old lady,” said Cameron.
“Van Reypen will be well fixed. He’s a good
all-round man, I like him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know him well,” said Chick, “I met
him a few times. A thorough aristocrat, I
should say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of that. They’re among the oldest of
the Knickerbockers. But nothing of the snob
about him. A right down good fellow and a
loyal friend. Well, I must go. Command me,
Mrs. Nan, if I can do the least thing for our
Patty Girl. Keep up a good heart, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kit’s voice choked, and he went off without
further words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Channing soon followed, but all day the
young people kept calling or telephoning, for
Patty had hosts of friends and they all loved
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan went to her room to write a note of sympathy
to Philip. Her own heart full of sorrow
and anxiety, she felt deeply for the young
man whose home death had invaded, and her
kindred trouble helped her to choose the right
words of comfort and cheer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day of Mrs. Van Reypen’s funeral, Patty
was very low indeed. Doctor and nurses held
their breath as their patient hovered on the
borderland of the Valley of Shadow, and
Patty’s father, with Nan sobbing in his arms,
awaited the dread verdict or the word of glorious
hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty stirred restlessly, her breathing laboured
and difficult. “I—did—promise,” she said in
very low, but clear tones, “but I didn’t—oh, I
didn’t—<span class='it'>want</span> to—I didn’t——” her voice
trailed away to silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>is</span> that promise?” whispered the doctor
to Nan. “It’s been troubling her——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know at all. She usually tells
me her troubles, but I don’t know what this
means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a slight commotion below stairs.
The doctor looked at a nurse, and she moved
noiselessly out to command quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s eyes opened wide, they looked very
blue, and their glance was more nearly rational
than it had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sh!” she said, weakly. “Listen! It <span class='it'>is</span>!
Yes, it <span class='it'>is</span>. Tell him to come up, I want to see
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it?” asked the doctor. “She mustn’t
see anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must,” whimpered Patty, beginning to cry;
“it’s Little Billee; I want him now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For heaven’s sake, she’s rational!” exclaimed
the doctor. “Bring him up, whoever
he is, if she says so! No matter if it’s an elephant,
bring him at once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half frightened, Nan went out into the hall.
Sure enough, big Bill Farnsworth was halfway
upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard her!” he said, in a choked voice,
“she said she wanted me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Nan, and led the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Softly Farnsworth stepped inside the door,
gently as a woman he took Patty’s thin little
hand in his two big strong ones, as he sat down
in a chair beside her bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little Billee,” and Patty smiled faintly, “I
want somebody to strong me—I’m so weak—you
can——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear,” and firmly holding her hand in
one of his, Farnsworth softly touched her eyelids
with his fingertips, and the white lids fell
over the blue eyes, and with a contented little
sigh, Patty sank into a natural sleep, the first
in many days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Released from his nervous tension, the doctor’s
set features relaxed. He looked in gratified
amazement at the sleeping girl, and at the
two astonished nurses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will live,” he said, softly. “But it is
like a miracle. On no account let her be awakened;
but you may move, sir. She is in a sound
sleep of exhaustion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth rose,—laying down Patty’s hand
lightly as a snowflake,—and soundlessly left the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan and Mr. Fairfield followed, after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found the big fellow looking out of the
hall window. At their footsteps, he turned,
making no secret of the fact that he was wiping
the tears from his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know—” he said, brokenly, “until
yesterday. I was in Chicago,—I made the best
connections I could, and raced up here. Have
I—is she—all right now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” and Fred Fairfield grasped Farnsworth’s
hand. “Undoubtedly you saved her
life. It was the crisis. If she could sleep—they
said,—and she is sleeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” and the honest blue eyes of
the big Westerner filled again with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank <span class='it'>you</span>, too,” cried Nan, and she shook
his hand with fervour. “Come into my sitting-room,
and tell me all about it. How did Patty
know you were here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you tell her?” Bill looked amazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; she must have heard your voice—downstairs——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I scarcely spoke above my breath!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She heard it,—or divined your presence
somehow, for she said you were there and she
wanted you,—the first rational words she has
spoken!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless her heart! Perhaps she heard me,
perhaps it was telepathy. I don’t know, or
care. She wanted me, and I was there. I am
glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man looked so proud and yet so humble
as he said this, that Nan forgot her dislike
and distrust of him, and begged him to stay
with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” he said. “That wouldn’t do. I’ll
be in New York a few weeks now, at the Excelsior.
I’ll see you often,—and Patty when
I may,—but I won’t stay here, thanks. I’m
so happy to have been of service, and always
command me, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth bowed and went off, and the two
Fairfields looked at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an episode!” exclaimed Nan. “Did
he really save her life, Fred?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He probably did. We can never say for
certain, but at that crisis, a natural sleep is a
Godsend. He induced it, whether by a kind of
mesmerism, or whether because Patty cares so
much for him, I can’t say. I hate to think the
latter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for one thing, you know that story
Van Reypen tells, about Farnsworth trying to
get Patty to go on the operatic stage——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never was sure about that—we didn’t hear
it so very straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, and Farnsworth is not altogether of—of
our own sort——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean, not the aristocrat Phil is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all that doesn’t matter just now. If
the doctor says Bill saved Patty’s life, I
shall always adore him, and I shall erect a
very high monument to his honour. So there,
now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan was almost gay. The revulsion of feeling
brought about by Patty’s improved condition
made her so joyous she had to express it in
some way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, she tiptoed to the door, and beckoned
the nurse out. From her she demanded and
received assurance that Patty was really past
the present danger, and barring relapse or complication,
would get well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she flew to the telephone and told Mona,
leaving her to pass the glad news on to the
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wanted to call up Van Reypen, but was
uncertain whether to do so or not. He was
but just returned from his aunt’s burial, and
the time seemed inopportune. Yet, he would
be so anxious to hear, and perhaps no one else
would tell him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So she called him, telling the servant who
answered, who she was, and saying Mr. Van
Reypen might speak to her or not, as he wished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I want to speak to you,” Phil’s
deep voice responded; “how is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better, really better. She will get well, if
there are no setbacks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, <span class='it'>I am</span> so glad. Mrs. Nan, I have been
so saddened these last few days. I couldn’t go
to you as I wished, because of affairs here.
Now, dear old aunty is laid to rest, and soon
I must come over. I don’t hope to see Patty,
but I want a talk with you. May I come tonight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely, Philip. Come when you will, you are
always welcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t know,” Nan said to Fred Fairfield,
“what Philip will say when he knows
who it was that brought about Patty’s recovery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need he know? Need anybody know?
Perhaps when Patty can have a say in the matter,
she will not wish it known. The nurses
won’t tell. Need we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not,” said Nan, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>PATTY’S FORTUNE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>hough Patty’s recovery was steady,
it was very, very slow. The utmost care
was taken against relapse; and so
greatly had the disease sapped her strength,
that it seemed well-nigh impossible for her to
regain it. But skilled nursing proved effectual
in the end, and the day came at last when Patty
was allowed to see one or two visitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adele was the first to be admitted to the presence
of the convalescent. She had come down
from Fern Falls as soon as the welcome word
reached her that she might see Patty. She was
to remain with her but a few moments, and
then, if no harm resulted, the next day Mona
was to be admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty herself was eager to see her friends, and
showed decided interest in getting arrayed for
the occasion of Adele’s visit. This greatly
pleased Nurse Adams for until now, Patty had
turned a deaf ear to all news or discussion of
the outer world, and had shown a listless
apathy when Nan or her father told her of the
doings of the young people of her set. This
had been partly due to her weakened condition
and partly to her brooding in secret over the
promise she had given Mrs. Van Reypen. She
had never mentioned this subject to Nan, nor
had they yet told Patty of Mrs. Van Reypen’s
death. The doctor forbade the introduction
of any exciting topic, and this news of her dear
old friend would surely startle her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll wear my blue <span class='it'>crêpe de chine</span> negligée,”
Patty directed; “the one with lace insets. And
the cap with Empire bows and rosebuds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delightful!” said Miss Adams. “It will
be a pleasant change to see you dressed up for
company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t been dolled up in so long, I ’most
forget how to primp, but I daresay it will come
back to me, for I’m a very vain person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good,” and Nurse Adams laughed.
“It’s always a good sign when a patient revives
an interest in clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if I ever lost mine, really. It was
probably lying dormant all through the late unpleasantness.
Now, please, my blue brocade
mules and some blue stockings,—or, no,—white
ones, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Adams brushed the mop of golden curls,
that had been so in the way during the severe
illness, and massed them high on the little head,
crowning all with the dainty cap of lace and
ribbons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I will gracefully recline on my boudoir
couch, and await the raising of the curtain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You darling thing!” cried Adele, as she
entered, “if you aren’t the same old Patty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Course I am! Who did you think I would
be? Oh, but it’s good to see you! I haven’t
seen a soul but the Regular Army for weeks
and months and years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty had never referred to Farnsworth’s
presence, and no one had spoken of it to her.
They had concluded that she was really unconscious
of it, or it had lapsed from her memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re looking so well. Your cheeks
are quite pink, and, why, I do declare, you look
almost pretty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> think I look ravishingly beautiful. I’ve
consulted a mirror today for the first time, and
I was so glad to see myself again, it was quite
like meeting an old friend. How’s Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine. Sent you so many loving messages, I
decline to repeat them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear old Jim. Give him my best. Tomorrow
I’m to see Mona. Isn’t that gay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I’d rather you’d be more interested
in my call than to be looking forward to
hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You old goose! Do you s’pose I’d had you
first, if I didn’t love you most?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I know you’re getting well. You’ve
not lost your knack of making pretty speeches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a comfort to have somebody to make
them to. The doctors were most unimpressionable,
and I can’t bamboozle Miss Adams
with flattery. She won’t stand for it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white-garbed nurse smiled at her pretty
patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” Patty went on, “after Mona, I’m
to see Elise and the other girls, and then if you
please, I’m to be allowed to see some of my
boy friends!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you coquette! You’re just looking forward
with all your eyes to having Chick and
Kit and all the rest come in and tell you how
well you’re looking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” and Patty folded her hands demurely.
“It’s such pleasant hearing, after weeks of
looking like a holler-eyed mummy, all skin and
bone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, you’re incorrigible,” and Adele
laughed fondly at the girl she loved so well.
“But you’re certainly looking the part of interesting
invalid, all right. Isn’t she, Mrs.
Fairfield?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” said Nan, who had just appeared
in the doorway. “And your visit is doing her
a lot of good. Why, she looks quite her old
self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sort of reincarnated version of her old
self, all made over new. By the way, Patty, I
saw Maude Kent yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you, Adele? What is she doing now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Concerts as usual. I heard about her session
with your father!” and Adele laughed.
“The idea of her thinking you’d dream of the
stage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But think what a great tragedienne is lost
to the world!” said Patty. “I know I have
marvelous talent, but my stern parents refused
to let me prove it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most outrageous ideal!” declared Nan.
“Nobody but that Mr. Farnsworth would
have suggested such a thing! I suppose Westerners
have a different code of conventions
from ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill Farnsworth suggest it!” cried Patty.
“Why, Nan, you’re crazy! He’s the one who
kept me from it. Wasn’t he, Adele?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, Mrs. Nan. It was he who went
over to Poland Spring with Patty——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s what I heard. Took Patty over
there to see this Kent person about the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness, gracious me!” Patty exclaimed;
“wherever did you get such a mixup, Nansome?
Why, it was Little Billee who gave
Maude whatfor, because she mentioned the
idea! He told her never to dream of it, and
made me go straight home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan looked puzzled. “Why,” she said,
“Philip Van Reypen told me that Mr. Farnsworth
put you up to it, and said you were good-looking
enough——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty laughed outright. “Oh, Nannie, I remember
that! <span class='it'>I</span> said I was good-looking
enough, and Bill said yes, I was <span class='it'>that</span>,—of
course, he had to agree!—but he said that had
nothing to do with the matter. And as to
Phil, he knew nothing about it. He wasn’t
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Somebody told him, that day he met
you all in Boston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, fiddle-de-dee! Somebody said that
somebody else heard that somebody—Now,
listen here, Nan, nobody put me up to that stage
business ’ceptin’ my own little self, and, of
course, Maude, who told me about it. But she
did nothing wrong in giving me the chance. And
it’s all past history, only don’t you say Little
Billee egged me on, because he most emphatically
egged me off. Didn’t he, Adele?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he did. You told me all about it at
the time. Bill Farnsworth was most indignant
at Miss Kent, but she was a friend of Chick
Channing’s and so Bill wouldn’t say anything
against her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t anything against her,” declared
Patty, “and Little Billee wouldn’t say it if there
were. But you just remember that he was on
the other side of the fence. If anybody sort of
approved of it, it was Chick. He thought it
would be rather fun, but he didn’t take it seriously
at all. So you just cross off that black
mark you have against Big Bill!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” promised Nan, and Adele said,
“Where is Bill now? Have you seen him of
late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Patty; “not since before I was
ill. I don’t know where he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan looked at her closely, but it was evident
she was speaking in earnest. As they thought,
then, she had forgotten the incident of his appearance
at her bedside. Perhaps she never
really knew of it, as she was so nearly unconscious
at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is in New York,” said Nan, covertly
watching Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he?” said Patty, with some animation.
“After I get well enough to see men-people,
I’d like to have him call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” returned Nan, “but now I’m
going to take Adele away. The nurse has been
making signals to me for five minutes past.
You mustn’t get overtired with your first visitor,
or you can’t have others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But visitors seemed to agree with Patty.
Once back in the atmosphere of gay chatter and
laughter with her friends, she grew better rapidly,
and the roses came back to her cheeks
and the strength to her body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, when they thought she could bear
it, they told her of Mrs. Van Reypen’s
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suspected it,” said Patty, her eyes filling
with tears, “just because you didn’t say anything
about her, and evaded my questions.
When was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They told her all about it, and then Mr. Fairfield
said, “And, my child, in her will was a
large bequest for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Patty, and her fingers locked
nervously together. “A hundred thousand
million dollars! Or it might as well be. I
don’t want the money, Daddy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is yours, and in your trust. You can’t
well refuse it. Half is for——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know,—for a Children’s Home. But
I can’t build a house now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t think about those things until you are
stronger. The Home project will keep,—for
years, if need be. And when the time comes,
all the burdensome details will be in the hands
of a Board of Trustees and you needn’t carry
it on your poor little shoulders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t that that’s bothering me, but my own
half. You don’t know <span class='it'>why</span> she gave me that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did she?” said Nan, quickly, her
woman’s mind half divining the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She made me promise, the last time I saw
her, that—that I would marry Philip. And
when I said I wouldn’t promise, she was very
angry, and said then she wouldn’t leave me the
money. And I was madder than she was, and
said I didn’t want her old money, and neither I
don’t, with Philip or without him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what an extraordinary proceeding!”
exclaimed Mr. Fairfield. “She tried to buy
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, of course she didn’t put it that
way, but she was all honey and peaches and
leaving me fortunes and building Children’s
Homes until I refused to promise, <span class='it'>then</span> she
turned and railed at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then——” prompted Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I was mad and I tried to start for
home. Then she calmed down and was sweet
again, and said she didn’t mean to balance the
money against the promise, but, well—she kept
at me until she <span class='it'>made</span> me give in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you promised?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor little Patty,” cried Nan; “you
poor, dear, little thing! How could she torture
you so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was, Nan,” cried Patty, eagerly; “it was
just that,—torture. Oh, I’m so glad you can
see it! I didn’t know <span class='it'>what</span> to do. She said
I mustn’t refuse the request of a dying woman,
and she grabbed my arm and shook me, and she
looked like a—oh, she just looked <span class='it'>terrifying</span>,
you know, and she—well, I guess she hypnotised
me into promising.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she did! It’s a perfect shame!”
and Nan gathered Patty into her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> a shame,” agreed Mr. Fairfield, smiling
at his daughter, “but it won’t be such an
awfully hard promise to keep, will it, Little
Girl? Of course you hated to have it put to
you in that manner, but there are less desirable
men in this world than Philip Van
Reypen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to talk about it,” said Patty,
and she burst into tears on Nan’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you sha’n’t,” returned Nan, caressing
her. “Go away, Fred. A man doesn’t know
how to deal with a case like this. Patty isn’t
strong enough yet to think of bothersome
things. You go away and we’ll tell you later
what we decide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fairfield rose, grumbling, laughingly,
that it was the first time he had ever been called
down by his own family. But he went away,
saying over his shoulder, “You girls just want
to have a tearfest, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me all about it, dear,” said Nan, as
Patty smiled through her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s about all, Nancy. But it was such a
horrid situation. I do like Phil, but I don’t
want to make any such promise as that. Of
course, Phil has asked me himself, several
times, but I’ve never said yes——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or no?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or no. I don’t have to till I get ready, do
I? And I surely don’t have to give my promise
to the aunt of the person most interested. Oh,
I’m so sorry she died. I wanted to ask her to
let me off. I dreamed about it all the time I
was sick. It was like a continual nightmare.
Has Phil been here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, two or three times. He wants to see
you as soon as you say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I see him? Do you suppose he
knows of my promise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely she told him. I don’t know.
But, Patty, don’t blame her too much. You
know, she was very fond of you, and she worshipped
him. It was the wish of her heart,—but,
no, she <span class='it'>hadn’t</span> any right to force your
promise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what she did, she forced it. Nan,
am I bound by it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no; that is, not unless you want to be.
Or unless——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless I consider a promise made to a dying
person sacred. Well, I’m afraid I do. I’ve
thought over this thing, day in and day out,
and it seems to me I’d be <span class='it'>wicked</span> to break a
promise given to one who is gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe Philip will let you off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he won’t. I know Phil wants me to
marry him, <span class='it'>awfully</span>, and he’d take me on any
terms. This sounds conceited, but I <span class='it'>know</span>,
’cause he’s told me so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Patty, why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just it. I don’t know why not. Sometimes
I think it’s just because I don’t want to
be made to do a thing, whether I choose or not.
And then sometimes,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes I think I don’t love Phil enough
to marry him. He’s a dear, and he’s awfully
kind and generous and good. And he adores
me,—but I don’t feel—say, Nan, were you <span class='it'>terribly</span>
in love with father when you married
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was, Patty. And I still am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know you are now. But were you
before the wedding day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m not <span class='it'>terribly</span> in love with Phil. But
he says that will come after we’re married.
Will it, Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hard to advise you, Patty. I daren’t
say the greater love will come to you,—for I
don’t know. But don’t marry him unless you
are sure he is the only man in the world you
can love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to marry him,” said Patty, simply;
“I promised.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>A DISTURBING LETTER</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>hen the days came when Patty could
see anybody and everybody who called
upon her. When she could be downstairs
in the library or the big cheery living-room,
and, as she expressed it, be “folks” once
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still flowers were sent to her, still candies and
fruit and dainty delicacies arrived in boxes and
baskets, and friends sent books, pictures, and
letters. Her mail was voluminous, so much
so that Nurse Adams who still tarried, was
pressed into service as amanuensis and general
secretary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men had begun to be allowed to call, and
Patty saw Cameron and Channing, who happened
to call first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My, but it’s good to gaze on your haughty
beauty again!” said Chick; “I’ve missed you
more than tongue can tell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me too,” said Kit. “I wanted to telephone,
but they wouldn’t let me. Said I was too near
and dear to be heard without being seen,—like
the children, or whoever it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you had,” and Patty laughed. “I
was longing to babble over a telephone, as we
used to do, Kit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in the early days of our courtship,
when we were twenty-one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak for yourself, John! I’ll leave it to
Chick,—<span class='it'>do</span> I look twenty-one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say not! You look sweet sixteen,
or thereabouts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right, for Patty did look adorably
young and sweet. She had on a Frenchy tea-gown
of pale green silk, bubbling over with
tulle frills of the same shade, touched here and
there with tiny rosebuds. A fetching cap of
matching materials, was, Nan declared, a mere
piece of affectation, but it accented her invalidism,
and was vastly becoming. Her face, still
pale from her illness, was of a waxen hue, but
a warm pink had begun to glow in her cheeks
and her blue eyes were as twinkling and roguish
as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what’s more,” Patty went on, “I won’t
be twenty-one till next May,—and that’s ages
away yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, about half a year!” retorted Kit, “so
I’m not so very far out, my little old lady! Did
you get all the tokens I sent you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess I did. I’m acknowledging ’em up as
fast as I can. I had such oodles of stuff. I
begrudge the flowers that came while I was
too lost to the world to see them, but enough
have come since to make up. You’ll get your
receipts in due time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. I was afraid mine were lost in the
shuffle. I say, Patty, when can you go out for
a spin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not this week. Next, maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go with me first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, me,” put in Chick. “I’ve a limousine,
he has only a runabout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lots more fun in a runabout. Besides, I
asked you first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What fun!” cried Patty, clapping her hands.
“It’s like a dance. I’m going to have a programme.
Wait, here’s one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty found an old dance programme in the
desk near her, and Kit kindly essayed to rub
off the names. Then with his fountain pen he
wrote over the dances, “Limousine Ride.”
“Runabout Spin.” “Walk.” “Skate.”
“Opera.” “Dance.” “Matinée,” and a host
of other pleasures to which Patty might reasonably
expect to be invited soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she would only allow them one each, and
after they had written their names after the
motor-car rides, they were shooed away by ever
watchful Nan, who would not allow Patty to
become overtired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, one morning, in the mail came a communication
from Mrs. Van Reypen’s lawyer. It
informed Patty of the legacy left her. As Mrs.
Van Reypen had said, there was a bequest of
fifty thousand dollars to Patty herself, and another
fifty thousand in trust for a fund for a
Children’s Home. The details of the institution
were left entirely to Patty’s discretion,
and she was instructed, if in need of more
funds, to apply to Philip Van Reypen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also was enclosed a note which Mrs. Van
Reypen had written and directed to be given to
Patty after her death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid to open it, Nan,” said Patty,
trembling as she looked at the sealed epistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wonder you feel so, dear. Let me
read it first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gladly Patty passed it over, for she had no
secrets from Nan, and her nerves were not
yet as strong as before her illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan read it, and then said. “You need have
no fear, Patty, it’s a dear note. Listen:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“My Dear Little Patty:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I made you sorrowful when I
talked to you and urged you to promise the
thing I asked of you. But don’t feel hard toward
me. I have your interests at heart as well as
Philip’s, and I know that what you have promised
will mean your life’s happiness. Now,
about the Children’s Home. If you feel that
after all it is too great a tax on your time or
strength to take it in charge, don’t do so. Turn
it all over to some one else. You and Philip
can decide on the right person for the work.
But I trust you will have an interest in it, and
see to it that the furnishings and little comforts
are as you and I would choose were we working
together. This note, dear, is to say good-bye.
I shall not see you again, but I die content,
knowing you will love and look after my boy.
It seemed strange at first to your girl heart,
but you will come to love him as your own, and
your life together will be filled with joy and
peace. Good-bye, my child, have a kindly remembrance
in your heart for your old friend,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“<span class='sc'>Lady Van</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was crying as Nan finished. It so
brought back the fine but eccentric old lady,
and so renewed that dreadful promise, that the
girl was completely upset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” she sobbed, “I’ve got to marry
him. This is like a voice from the grave, holding
me to my vow. Isn’t it, Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, look here. Do you want to marry
Phil, or don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the quick, sharp question, Patty looked up
with a start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honest, Nan, I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you ought to find out. It’s this way,
Patty. If you do want to marry him, or if you
are willing to, there’s no use in fussing over
this promise business. If you don’t, and if
you are sure you don’t, then you must break
that promise. But, you’ve got to be sure
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I be sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anybody else you care for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N—no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kit Cameron is very much in love with you,
Patty. He asked me when you were ill, if I
thought he had a chance. Has he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the ghost of a chance! Kit’s an old
dear, and I like him a heap, but he’s a worse
flirt than I am. Mercy, Nan, I wouldn’t marry
him for a minute!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chick Channing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He’s a lovely boy to play around with,
but not to take for a life partner. Oh, well,
I s’pose it’ll have to be Phil, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father and I would like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Mrs. Van Reypen seemed to think she’d
like it; and I feel quite sure Phil would like
it; and it doesn’t matter about little old me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty! stop talking like that! You know
nobody wants you to do a thing you don’t want
to do! And don’t get mad at your Nan, who
has only your best interests at heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Deed I won’t! I’m a brute! A big, ugly,
horrid brute! Nansome, you’re my good angel.
Now, let’s drop this subject for a time,—or
I’ll get so nervous I’ll fly to the moon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you will! And you’re not going
to be bothered out of your life, either. You
put it all out of your mind, and come with me,
out for a ridy-by. Then back and have a nice
little nap. Then a ’normous big luncheon; and
then dress yourself all up pretty for callers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an entrancing programme! Nan,
sometimes I think you’re a genius! I sure do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The enticing programme was carried out, and
that afternoon Van Reypen came to call. It
was the first time he had seen Patty since her illness,
and she rather dreaded the meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Philip was so cheery and kindly that Patty
felt at ease at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear little girl,” he said, taking both her
hands, “how good to see you looking so well.
I’ve been <span class='it'>so</span> anxious about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Needn’t be any more,” said Patty, smiling
up at him. “I’m all well now, and never going
to be sick again. But I’ve been feeling very
sorry for you, Phil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, dear. It is hard, the old house
seems so empty and lonely. But Aunty Van
rather wanted to go, and she bade me think of
her only with pleasant memories, and not with
mourning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was always thoughtful of others’ feelings.
And, Phil, how she did love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She did. And you, too; why, I never supposed
she could care for any one outside our
family as she cared for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was awfully kind to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you were to her. You were mighty
good, Patty, to put up with her queer little notions
the way you always did. And I say, do
you know what she told me just before she
died? She told me that you said you would
learn to love me. Oh, Patty, did you? I don’t
doubt her word, but sometimes she thought a
thing was so, when really it was only her strong
wish. So I <span class='it'>must</span> ask you. I didn’t mean to
ask you today,—I meant to wait till you are
strong and well again. But, darling, you look
so sweet and dear, and I haven’t seen you for
so long, I can’t wait. Tell me, Patty, <span class='it'>did</span> you
tell Aunty Van that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty hesitated. A yes or no here meant
so much,—and yet she couldn’t put him
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” he urged; “you must have said
something of the sort. Even if she exaggerated,
she wouldn’t make it <span class='it'>all</span> up. What did
you tell her, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two were alone in the library. The dusk
was just beginning,—the lights not yet turned
on. Patty, in a great easy chair, sat near the
wood fire, which had burned down to a few
glowing embers. Van Reypen, restless, had
been stalking about the room. Now, he came
near to her, and pushing up an ottoman, he sat
down by her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must tell me,” he said, in a low, tense
voice.  “I can’t bear it if you don’t. I won’t
ask you anything more,—I’ll go right away,
if you say so,—but, Patty, dearest, tell me if
you told Aunty Van that you would learn to
love me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil’s dark, handsome face looked into her
own. With a feeling as of a tightening round
her heart, Patty realised that his eyes were very
like his aunt’s, that their impelling gaze would
yet make her say yes. And, fascinated, she
gazed back, until, coerced, she breathed a low
“yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, appalled at the look that came to his
face she covered her eyes with her hands, whispering,
“Go away, Phil. You said you’d go
away if I wanted you to, and I do want you to.
Please go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Van Reypen leaned nearer. “I will go, Little
Sweetheart. I can bear to go now. You have
made me so happy with that one little word.
The rest can wait. Good-bye, you will call me
back soon, I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bending down he dropped a light kiss on the
curly golden hair, and went away, happy in the
knowledge of Patty’s love, and almost amused
at what he thought was her shyness in acknowledging
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she heard the street door close, Patty
looked up. Her face was white, and she was
nervously trembling.</p>

<p class='caption'>“Tell me if you told Aunty Van that you would learn to love me”</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Nan,” she called; “Nan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan came in from another room. “What is
it, Patty, dear? Where is Philip?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s gone. Oh, Nan, I kept my promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did! What do you mean? Are you
engaged to Philip? Then why did he go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty laughed, but it was a little hysterical.
“I sent him away. No, we’re not engaged, that
is, I don’t think we are. But I suppose we will
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patty, behave yourself. Brace up, now, and
tell me what you’re talking about. Any one
would think getting engaged was a funeral or
some such occasion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty shook herself, and smiled at Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a goose, I suppose. I don’t know
whether I’m glad or sorry, but I told Phil I’d
learn to love him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m, I don’t see as you’ve bound yourself
to anything very desperate! You can doubtless
learn, if you study hard enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tease me, Nan. I’m not sure I want
to learn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then don’t! Patty, sometimes you’re perfectly
ridiculous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! Just ’cause <span class='it'>you</span> happened to get a
perfectly splendid man like my father, and
didn’t have to think twice, you think <span class='it'>everybody</span>
can decide in a hurry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan burst into laughter. “Oh, you are <span class='it'>too</span>
funny!” she cried, and Patty had to laugh, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I am,” she said, dolefully, “to
you. But to me it doesn’t seem funny a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, dear,” said Nan, repentantly;
“I won’t laugh any more. Tell me about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s that old promise thing. Mrs. Van told
Phil I had told her I would learn to love him,
and he asked me if I did. And I had to say yes.
And of course I couldn’t tell him she <span class='it'>made</span> me
promise. Now, could I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. It <span class='it'>is</span> a little serious, Patty,
unless, as I said before, unless you want to
learn to love him. Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, but I don’t think so. I wish
to goodness he wouldn’t bother me about it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sha’n’t! Patty, it is a shame for you to be
bothered if you don’t want to be. Now, I’ll
help you out. I’ll tell Phil, myself, that you’re
not well enough yet to be troubled about serious
matters, and he must wait till you are. He
won’t be angry, I can explain it to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care whether he’s angry or not. It
isn’t that, Nan. It’s that just the little bit I
said to him, he takes to mean—everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course he does, Patty. You can’t tell a
man you’ll learn to love him unless you mean
that you expect to succeed and that you’ll marry
him. What else <span class='it'>could</span> you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, if I said it of my own accord.
But, don’t you see, Nan, that I only said it because
I promised her I would, and it doesn’t
seem fair, that I should have to say it because
she made me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, Patty, it <span class='it'>doesn’t</span>. And you
ought not to be held by that infamous performance!
I just begin to see it as it is, and I am
not going to have you tortured. You don’t
really love Phil, or you’d know it; and this
‘promise’ and ‘learning to love him’ is all
foolishness. I’m going to tell him, or have
Fred do so, of that promise business, and then
if he wants to ask you again, and let you answer
of your own will, and not by anybody’s
coercion, very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Nan, what a duck you are! What
would I ever do without you! Will you really
do that? I tried to tell Phil how it was, but he
was so—so——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precipitate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that; but I meant more that he was so
glad to have me say that <span class='it'>yes</span>, that it seemed
too bad to tell him that awful story about his
aunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> an awful story, but he ought to know it.
Why, he’d rather know it. You two couldn’t
live all your lives with that secret between
you—could you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course we couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then, too, it isn’t fair to him. If you’re
answering his question under duress,—I never
did know what duress meant,—but anyway, if
you’re answering his questions at his aunt’s
commands, he certainly ought to know it. It’s
wrong to let him think it’s your own answer,
if it isn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” and Patty looked greatly relieved.
“Say, Nan, when can you tell him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t do it. I’ll get your father to.
He’s the proper one, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I guess he is,” sighed Patty. “Oh,
what do poor little girls do who haven’t such
kind parents? And now I wonder if it isn’t
time for my beef tea!”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>I</span>t was the next afternoon that Farnsworth
called. He had not seen Patty since the
day she was so very ill, but he had telephoned
or called every day to inquire after her.
Today he was allowed to see her, and as he
entered the library, his face was radiant with
sunny smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked up, smiling too, and held out her
hands in greeting. From the lace cap that
crowned her hair, to the tips of her dainty slippers,
she was all in white, and her pale face
and waxen hands made her look so like an angel
that big, strapping Bill held his breath as he
looked at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you really there?” he asked; “are you
fastened to earth? I somehow feel afraid you’ll
waft off into the ether, you look so ethereal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed! I’m here to stay. I’ve a pretty
strong liking for this old world and I’ve no desire
to flee away just yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! It’s great to see you again,” and
Farnsworth took a seat beside her. “I’m
thinking you’ll be getting out of doors soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so. But I’m having a beautiful time
convalescing. Everybody is so good to me, and
I’m showered with presents, as if I were—engaged!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I hear that you are.” Bill looked at
her steadily. “I’m told that you’re betrothed
to Van Reypen, and I want to be among the
first to wish you all the joy there is in the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you?” and Patty looked startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little bird,” Farnsworth smiled at her
gently. “I am very glad for you, dear. Philip
is a big, strong-hearted chap, and he can give
you all you want and deserve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Most anybody could do that,” said Patty,
a little shortly, for it seemed to her that Farnsworth
took the news of her engagement rather
easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I couldn’t. There are not many men
like Van Reypen; rich, well-born, intellectual,
and kind. Moreover, he has prestige and an
acknowledged place in the best society; all of
which goes to make up the atmosphere of life
that best suits you,—you petted butterfly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill’s smile robbed the words of any effect of
satire or reproof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I a feather-headed rattlepate?” and
Patty treated the young man to her best and
prettiest pout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not entirely. But you like to have all about
you in harmony and good taste. Nor are you
to blame. You are born to the purple,—and
all that that signifies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?” Farnsworth looked amazed. “No,
Patty; I am what they call a self-made man.
My people are plain people, and my childhood
was one of rough experiences,—even hardships.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the more credit to you, Little Billee, for
turning out a polished gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m not, dear. I’ve picked up enough
of social customs not to make awkward mistakes,
but I have not the innate breeding of the
Van Reypens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth was not looking at Patty, he was
staring into vacancy, and looked as if he were
talking more to himself than to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish!” said Patty, gaily, annoyed at
herself for feeling the truth of his words.
“You’re a splendid old Bill, and whoever says
a word against you is no friend of mine! So
be careful, sir, what you say against yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a loyal little friend, Patty, and I’m
more glad than you can realise to know that
it is so. Now, you’re going to do all you can
to grow stronger, aren’t you? It hurts me to
see you so white and wan-looking. I wish I
could give you some of my big strength,—I’ve
more than I know what to do with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this speech Patty blushed a rosy crimson,
and Farnsworth’s remark about her wan looks
lost its point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the apple blossoms in your cheeks,
Little Girl?” and he smiled at her evident confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you give me of your strength, Bill,—if—if
I were—were—dying——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t I! I’d snatch you back from old
Charon, if you had one foot in his boat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty looked at him, with a queer uncertainty
in her eyes. Twice she tried to say something,
and couldn’t; and then Farnsworth said softly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I did,—although I doubt if you knew it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you, Billee? <span class='it'>Really?</span> I thought it was
a dream,—wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean—that day——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Patty, it was not a dream. I chanced
to come in, and when I asked about you, you
must have heard my voice, for you called out
to me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. And you wanted some of my strength,—I
gave it to you by putting you to sleep.
That was what you needed most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that the crisis, Bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They said so, dear. I am glad I could
help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saved my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure of that, but I wish I had, for
you know there is a convention that gives saved
lives to the savers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it, then,” said Patty, impulsively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth gave her a long look. “I wouldn’t
want it because you thought you <span class='it'>ought</span> to give
it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet that is why I’m giving it to Philip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t save your life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I mean I’m giving it to him because I
think I ought to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>do</span> you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Patty told him the whole story of
her promise to Mrs. Van Reypen, and her consequent
enforced betrothal to Philip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farnsworth’s blue eyes opened wide. “And
he takes you on those terms!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he doesn’t know about the promise. But
what else can I do, Little Billee? I can’t break
a promise made to a dying woman, and—too—I
like Phil——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like isn’t enough,” said Farnsworth,
sternly. “Do you love him, Patty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I guess so——” she stammered, a little
frightened at his vehemence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that very moment Philip Van Reypen
appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Peaches,” he said gaily to Patty.
“How do, Farnsworth? And how’s our interesting
invalid today?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m fine,” returned Patty. “Getting better
by the minute. ’Spect to go out coasting soon.
Better get your sleds ready, we may have snow
any day——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty was babbling on to cover a certain constraint
in the attitude of the two men. But
almost immediately, Farnsworth took his leave,
gently declining Patty’s plea to stay longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him go,” said Philip, as the street door
closed behind Bill; “I want to see you alone.
See here, Patty, what’s this about a promise to
Aunty Van?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father. Sent and asked me to come
to his office, so I went, and he told me the whole
story. You poor little girl! I’m <span class='it'>so</span> sorry it
happened, and I’ve come to ask you to forgive
Aunty Van. She was all wrong to do such a
thing, but honestly, she was actuated by right
motives. She loved you so, and she loved me,
and she was so sure we were made for each
other. I’m sure of that, too,—but if you’re
not, you’re to say so, and not think you’re bound
by a promise to <span class='it'>anybody</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I did promise her——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forget it! In your dealings with me, you’re
to deal only with me. There’s no go-between
or dictator or even adviser; only just our two
selves. But before we begin on our affairs, I
want this other matter settled for all time.
Promise me that you will never again even think
of that promise that she wrung from you. You
<span class='it'>must</span>, or I can’t have loving memories of Aunty
Van. Also, I want you to tell me truly, whether
you want to look after the Children’s Home
scheme or not. If it’s a burden, you’re not to
have anything to do with it. See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How kind you are, Phil. Yes, I do want
to help with the Home project, but I don’t want
to be at the head of the Board,—or whatever
has charge of it. I want to tend to the furnishings
and little comforty things for the kiddies,
but can’t somebody else build it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course they can! You dear Baby, do you
think you’re to have all that on your poor little
shoulders? It shall all be just as you say. And
you are to do as much or as little as you like.
Of course, you’re not even to think of it, till
you’re all well and strong again. Now, as to
your own bequest from Aunty Van. I can’t tell
you how glad I am she left you a little pin-money——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little pin-money!” exclaimed Patty, raising
her eyes heavenward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, an enormous fortune,—if you like that
better. But at any rate, it’s yours, to do as
you please with. I don’t suppose you really
need it, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t need it for myself, Phil, but oh, I’m
going to do such lovely things with it for my
girls! I shall use it for their vacation trips and—that
is, part of it. Part of it, I’m going to
spend on myself—oh, I have the delightfullest
plans!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Pattykins, do what you will, as
long as it pleases your own dear self. And
now, we come to what interests me most. I
decline to have you for my very own, if you
consent <span class='it'>only</span> because Aunty Van made you
promise to do so. Cut that all out,—and let’s
begin again. Will you promise me,—<span class='it'>me</span>, mind
you,—not any one else <span class='it'>for</span> me,—to learn to
love me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Patty was her own roguish self
again. The release from the bugbear promise
was so great, that she considered gaily what
Phil was asking now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she began, looking provokingly
pretty, “suppose I say I’ll <span class='it'>try</span> to learn to love
you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, try—to endeavour—to attempt—to
make a stab at it! But, all right, I’ll take that
crumb of a promise. You’ll <span class='it'>try</span> to learn to love
me. Patty, <span class='it'>I’m</span> going to be the teacher, and if
you’ll try,—and you’ll have to, since you’ve
promised,—by Jove, I’ll <span class='it'>make</span> you learn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” and Patty’s eyes danced; “when
you going to begin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right off, this minute. And never stop, short
of success?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Van Reypen looked very handsome, his dark
hair tossed back from his broad forehead, his
dark eyes alight with love and determination.
He was the sort of man who meets any circumstances
with graceful un-selfconscious ease, and
he sat back in his chair, looking at Patty with
an air of assured proprietorship, that amused
rather than irritated her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m not engaged to you,” and Patty
shook her lace-capped head till her curls
bobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Oh, <span class='it'>do</span> be! Let’s be <span class='it'>that</span>, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! engaged before I’ve learned to love
you! Nevaire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Sweetness. I’ll wait. But it won’t
be long. The poet babbles of ‘love’s protracted
growing,’ but ours won’t be so terribly
protracted, I promise you! I’ll give you a
week to decide in,—and that’s too long——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A week! I couldn’t begin to get ready to
think about it in that time! Give me a month,
and I’ll go you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, your wish is law. A month from
today, then, you’re to complete your lessons,
and graduate a full-fledged ladylove of your
humble servant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you’re so awfully humble,
Philip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t be, while I have you to be proud of!
Oh, Patty, do decide quicker’n a month! That
seems a century! Say a fortnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope. A month it is, before I need to say
yes or no to your question. One more month
of gay girlish freedom. Oh, Phil, I couldn’t
be tied down to any one man! I want to flirt
with all of them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do it in this month, then. For I warn you,
after thirty-one more days, your flirtations must
be laid aside, with your wax doll and Britannia
teaset.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem pretty positive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faint heart never won fair lady. I’ve lots
of faults, but a faint heart isn’t one of them.
You’re the girl for me, but you don’t quite know
it for sure,—<span class='it'>yet</span>. So I’m going to show you
the truth, and gently but firmly lead you to it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip kept the conversation in this light key,
and when he went away, Patty retained the impression
of a very charming afternoon with
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He <span class='it'>is</span> nice,” she said to Nan, after telling
her all about it; “You feel so sort of sure of
him all the time. He always does the right
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day brought many visitors, but among
the most welcome was Baby Milly, or Middy,
as she called herself, and as Patty always
called her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such a booful Patty!” the child exclaimed,
delighted at seeing her again after so long a
time. “Middy loves you drefful! See, Middy
b’inged lot o’ Naws!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She means Noahs, ma’am,” explained the
nurse who had Milly in charge. “They’re the
dolls from her Noah’s Ark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, the baby had the four straight-garmented
puppets that represent in painted
wood, the patriarch and his three sons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were up in Patty’s boudoir and the little
one gaily stood her cherished toys round
among the small ferns in the window-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Patty grabbed her up and carried
her off to have a feast of bread and jam and
milk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice party,” the guest remarked. “Des
Patty an’ Middy. Ve’y nice party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the party, the little one was taken
home, and so it was not until she went to
her room that night, that Patty discovered
the four “Naws” still marching through her
ferns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blessed baby!” she said to herself, as she
collected the illustrious quartette, and laid them
on the table to be returned to their owner the
next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Patty threw herself in a big chair, to
think over her problems. She hadn’t told
Farnsworth that she was not now engaged to
Philip, and she didn’t quite like to tell him,
though why, she couldn’t say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder who I like best of anybody
in all the world,” she mused, as she played idly
with Middy’s toys. “I’m as uncertain of that,
as I am which of these four statuettes I prefer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked critically at the Noah, and at Shem,
Ham and Japheth; a little undecided as to
which was which, so similar were they in every
respect save as to the colours of their long one-piece
gowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood them in a row on the table. “That’s
Philip,” looking at one of them; “that’s Little
Billee; that’s Kit, and the yellow one is Chick
Channing. I’ve come to like Chick a lot,—more’n
Kit, I believe. Now, let’s see. S’pose
I had to lose one of these four forever; which
could I best spare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The game grew exciting. Patty, sitting on one
foot, leaned toward the table, middle finger-tip
caught against her thumb, ready to snap the
least desirable into limbo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” she said, “but old Kit must go.”
She snapped her fingers, and luckless Kit flew
across the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty’s face fell. “It’s a hard world! But
I’m going to fight this thing to a finish. And
there’s no use mincing matters, if another had
to go—it would, of course, be Chick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another flick of her slender fingers, and Channing
flew up in the air and landed on the high
mantel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then,” and Patty knew that a momentous
decision lay before her. There remained
Philip and Bill Farnsworth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patty clasped her hands, rested her chin upon
them and stared at the brown and red-coated
gentlemen still standing before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phil is such a dear,” she reasoned, as if trying
to convince herself; “and he certainly does
worship the ground I walk on. But there’s
something about Bill—dear Little Billee! I
wonder what it is about him—And he <span class='it'>did</span> save
my life—I think I like him for his strength. I
never saw anybody so strong—he always makes
me think of Sir Galahad;—‘His strength was
as the strength of ten because his heart was
pure.’ Little Billee’s heart is pure,—pure gold.
I—somehow, I know it by a sort of intuition.
And yet, Phil—oh, Philip is a gentleman, of
course, I know that, but Bill is nature’s nobleman—well
any way, just at this minute, I like
Little Billee better than anybody in the world!
So, there now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a well-aimed flick of her fingertips, Patty
set Philip spinning, and it was a week later that
she found him in her work-basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had the grace to look a little ashamed of
herself, but the fire of determination was in her
eye, and a rosy flush tinted her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a mischievous smile came to the corners
of her mouth, and on an impulse she caught up
the telephone from the stand, and called the
Excelsior Hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments Farnsworth’s “Hello”
sounded in her ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Patty,” she said, in a small, timid voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad. Are we to have a little
chat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,—I just wanted to tell you—to tell
you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; dear Little Girl,—what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t seem to tell you after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I come over there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, it’s too late. I only wanted to say
that—that I’m not really engaged to anybody—now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank heaven! and,—do you want to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! Not for a month. I’ve got that
long to make up my mind in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! May I see you in the meantime?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless you take that laugh out of your
voice! I do believe you’re making fun of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help a laugh in my voice when the
dull world has suddenly turned to rosy sunlight!
Tell me, Apple Blossom, is that all you called
up to say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” and Patty’s eyes grew luminous; “I
<span class='it'>was</span> going to say something else——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it,—tell me,—Patty-sweet,——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only—that at this present moment,—just
for <span class='it'>one little minute</span>, you know, I like—you—better—than—anybody
else in all the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with a sudden click, Patty hung up the receiver,
and buried her burning face in her
hands.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
